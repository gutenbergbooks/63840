<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>Preface.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> issue of this volume has been
&ldquo;the accident of an accident.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was called by
commercial business last autumn to Oswestry, where I found,
temporarily located, a man with humour at his finger-ends, and of
&ldquo;infinite jest&rdquo; on paper.&nbsp; I allude to Mr. <span
class="smcap">Robert Cruikshank</span>, an artist scarcely
inferior to his celebrated brother, Mr. <span
class="smcap">George Cruikshank</span>&mdash;<i>par nobile
fratrum</i>, who have both successfully laboured in their
vocation to</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;Shoot folly as it flies,<br />
And catch the living manners as they rise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Robert Cruikshank, pleased with the rich and diversified
scenery of the neighbourhood of Oswestry, undertook to illustrate
the present book.&nbsp; To be thus pictorially aided was a
distinction, and I therefore cheerfully complied with the wish of
the respectable publisher, to try my &ldquo;&rsquo;prentice
hand&rdquo; at a History of the Borough.&nbsp; Mr. Cruikshank has
well executed his task.&nbsp; What may be <i>my</i> portion of
merit will be determined by the judgment, not critically severe,
I hope, of my readers.</p>
<p>The History of Oswestry and its neighbourhood is, however,
worthy of a more elaborate and carefully-wrought <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>volume than
that which I now send forth; and I should have been glad had some
pen, abler than my own, been employed in the completion of so
desirable a work.&nbsp; Oswestry is not deficient in the talent
or learning necessary to produce a voluminous history; but until
the historic mantle fall upon some kindred spirit, that can evoke
with magic skill the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> and chequered
incidents of bye-gone ages, and beguile his readers with
beautiful delineations of his native hills and vallies, the good
citizens of Oswestry must, I fear, content themselves with the
present volume, whose chief excellence, if it possess any, may be
found to consist in supplying a collection of interesting facts,
connected with the town and district, hitherto dispersed through
many publications.</p>
<p>In preparing this volume for the press much delay has occurred
from the pressure of other and more anxious engagements.&nbsp; In
wading, however, through musty tomes and modern books, I have
been instructed and solaced by the way.&nbsp; The Past reveals
little else than vandal darkness and the pride and pomp of feudal
power.&nbsp; Lords and their vassals figure chiefly in the
discordant scene, and ignorant dependence is too commonly seen
prostrate at the feet of favourites, in court or field, of
ambitious and despotic monarchs.&nbsp; The Present has a more
genial and encouraging aspect.&nbsp; Religion, with her gentle
handmaids, Literature, Science, and Art, is shedding its radiance
even over this district, so long the theatre of Border-feuds,
strife, and injustice.&nbsp; The Future, therefore, indicates
still more agreeable promise; and those of the present generation
who are co-operating in the good work already begun, of
endeavouring to make the world better than they found it, will
have the consolation of leaving to posterity an inheritance more
precious than silver or gold.</p>
<p><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>I cannot
close these remarks without thankfully acknowledging the
assistance I have derived, from several gentlemen of the town and
neighbourhood, in the prosecution of my labours.&nbsp; If I could
have stirred up many others to the grateful task of elucidating
the history of their native or adopted place of residence, I
should have been still more satisfied.&nbsp; I take this
opportunity of mentioning the names of The Rev. Thomas Salwey,
Vicar of Oswestry, Richard Redmond Caton, Esq., F.S.A., Edward
Williams, Esq., of Lloran House, R. J. Croxon, Esq., Charles
Sabine, Esq., and one or two other gentlemen, who, with a
becoming feeling of respect for the ancient borough, have kindly
aided me by various contributions.</p>
<p>I am sensible of many imperfections in the volume; but I
trust, by the generous support of the Public, I may be enabled,
at some not far distant day, to revise my pages, and render them
still more worthy of acceptance.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>History
of Oswestry.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">celebrated</span> writer has said, that
&ldquo;History is philosophy teaching by example.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Local History was doubtless included in the reflection of the
distinguished essayist, when he penned the memorable sentence,
which has for years past been adopted as a national maxim.&nbsp;
In Local History we have handed down to us facts and fiction,
both grave and gay; traditions and customs illustrative of
popular habits and manners; records of national edicts and social
laws; municipal mandates, and parochial practice; doleful notes
of superstition and ignorance, with gratifying statistics of the
progress of truth and enlightenment; pleasing reports of the
advancement of science and art, mechanical ingenuity, and
industrial pursuits; and, speaking comprehensively, with a keen
glance at the past, we descry enough, in the chequered examples
of byegone times, to help us on in wisdom&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>With these preliminaries, let us now lead our readers
pleasantly onward through the devious paths and labyrinths of
Oswestry&rsquo;s varied history, beguiling them, perchance, by
the way, with all that is agreeable pertaining to the <span
class="smcap">Ancient and Loyal Borough</span>, which, from its
antiquity, its scenes of martial daring and prowess, the tranquil
beauty of its surrounding landscapes, and its primitive, as well
as modern <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>relation to some of the sweetest spots of <span
class="smcap">Cambria</span>, has commanded the admiration and
homage of historians, painters, and poets.</p>
<h3>Derivation of Name, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>The derivation of the name of the Borough is still, and
perhaps ever will be, involved in obscurity.&nbsp; As a place of
retreat for the Cymry, or early Britons, when chased from the
south by the Roman invaders, it is not unlikely to have had a
primitive name that has been lost in the flood of ages.&nbsp;
Pennant, whose industry and historical research have earned for
him lasting fame, dates the commencement of its history in the
Saxon period, not anterior to the celebrated conflict at
Oswestry, between <i>Oswald</i>, the Christian King of the
Northumbrians, and <i>Penda</i>, the Pagan King of the Mercians,
which occurred in the year 642.&nbsp; Other Welsh biographical
and historical writers trace the origin of its name to a much
earlier period, and contend that <i>Oswal</i>, a son of Cunedda
Wledig, sovereign of the Stratclyde Britons, and who lived in the
early part of the fifth century, received from his father, as a
tribute for special military services, an extensive grant of
land, called from him <i>Osweiling</i>, in which the present town
of Oswestry is situated.&nbsp; The coincidence is extraordinary
that two distinguished chieftains should have
flourished&mdash;although upwards of two centuries had rolled
between their reigns&mdash;bearing names so similar to each
other, that from either, it may be presumed, the town could, not
inappropriately, have derived its present designation.&nbsp; The
evidence in favour of Oswald&rsquo;s right to the sponsorship of
Oswestry is, however, in our opinion, so strong, that we must
accord the honour to the Northumbrian Monarch, until the Cambrian
or British claim shall be more authoritatively established.&nbsp;
In the battle between <i>Oswald</i> and <i>Penda</i>, history
informs us that the former was defeated and fell; that the
barbarian victor ordered that the body of the slain monarch
should be cut in pieces, and &ldquo;stuck on stakes dispersed
over <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the
field as so many trophies; or, according to the ancient verses
that relate the legend, his head and hands only were thus
exposed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Three crosses, raised at
<i>Penda&rsquo;s</i> dire command,<br />
Bore <i>Oswald&rsquo;s</i> royal head and mangled
hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this battle the Welsh, or Cymry, (who seemed to have
possessed for some time the district including Oswestry,) had
called it <i>Croes-Oswallt</i> (Oswald&rsquo;s Cross), in
allusion to Penda&rsquo;s ignominious exposure of Oswald&rsquo;s
slaughtered body.&nbsp; The spot where the battle was fought is
said to have borne the name of <i>Maeshir</i> (the long field),
as marking the length and obstinacy of the conflict.&nbsp; In the
fulness of the Saxon period the town was known as
<i>Oswald&rsquo;s Tree</i>, in evident reference to
Oswald&rsquo;s death, and subsequently, to the present day,
&ldquo;without let or impediment,&rdquo; by the name of <span
class="smcap">Oswestry</span>.</p>
<p>Industrious and talented antiquarian writers have given to the
town other names and derivations.&nbsp; For instance, we are told
that it was termed by the Saxons <i>Blanc-Minster</i>,
<i>White-Minster</i>, <i>Album-Monasterium</i>, from its
&ldquo;fair and white Monastery,&rdquo; whilst the Cymry, or
&ldquo;Old Britons,&rdquo; as Williams denominates them,
&ldquo;called the town <i>Tre&rsquo;r Fesen</i>, <i>Tre&rsquo;r
Cadeiriau</i>, the Town of the Oak Chairs,&rdquo; or, as another
writer has it, &ldquo;the Town of Great Oaks.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
terms bear special allusion to Oswald&rsquo;s unfortunate arrival
in this district; for the ancient seal of the town, cut in brass,
represents King Oswald sitting in his robes on a chair, holding a
sword in his right hand, and an oak branch in his left, with the
words around, &ldquo;<i>De Oswaldestre sigillum
commune</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In repeating the long and tedious
catalogue of names and derivations, it will be proper to mention
that one writer renders the designation <i>Tre&rsquo;r
Cadeiriau</i> as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Oswestry was called by the
Britons <i>Tre&rsquo;r Cadeiriau</i>, literally the Town of
<i>Chairs</i>, or Seats, commanding an extensive view, (as
<i>Cadair Idris</i>, the chair of Idris, and others,) as there
are several eminences commanding such views in the
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Here is a
chapter on civic nomenclature and varied derivation, very
curious, perhaps, to many readers, but little edifying to those
who ask with the poet, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a
name?&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet, ancient civic names, like many other
ancient relics, have valuable and salutary uses.&nbsp; They are
as finger-posts to the Past; in some instances inviting us to the
honest path of truth and honour; in others deterring us from the
rugged ways of ignorance and error.&nbsp; In almost all respects
they enable us to institute comparisons and form contrasts
between men and manners in ancient and modern days.&nbsp; Whilst
looking at such names, we are too frequently reminded of times
when Might overcame Right, and are gently led with thankful
spirits to the Present, when, in our own happy and
highly-privileged age, every Briton can sit &ldquo;under his vine
and under his fig-tree,&rdquo; none daring to make him
afraid.</p>
<h3>REVIEW OF ANCIENT HISTORY.</h3>
<h4>The British Period.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> ages the site of the town, with
the surrounding district, was the theatre of brutal contention,
rapine, and aggrandisement.&nbsp; Here, as in the Border-Lands of
Scotland, it was</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
good old rule,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
* * * the simple plan,<br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Education had not spread her benign wings over the people, to
hush them into peace; and too commonly they who possessed the
strongest physical power and the wildest barbarism became, in
turns, &ldquo;Lords of the Ascendant.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no
record extant that the Roman invaders of Britain pitched their
tents within the Oswestrian district; and yet it is more than
probable that part of the legion, which traversed <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>from the south
of our island, actually touched at Llanymynech Hill (a Roman
settlement beyond doubt), and most likely constituted a portion
of the army which, under Suetonius, found its way along the
mountain-passes of North Wales into Anglesey, may have halted
there, if the ground was pre-occupied by the invaded Britons, or
the ancient encampment, <i>Hen Dinas</i>, had then stood.&nbsp;
We can produce nothing more than conjectural evidence of such a
visit.&nbsp; There is no Roman architecture in the town, to mark
the presence of the invaders, nor are there Roman relics rich as
those discovered at Llanymynech.&nbsp; If the Britons occupied
<i>Hen Dinas</i> during the Roman visit to the district, the
destruction of that encampment may have been accomplished by the
Roman marauders; and yet it is believed by some that the Britons
possessed Oswestry, intact, from before the death of Oswald to
the invasion of Offa.&nbsp; A Roman invasion of Oswestry, and the
real history of Hen Dinas (or Old Oswestry, as it is termed,) are
therefore alike still involved in mystery.</p>
<p>On this &ldquo;vexed question&rdquo; we may add the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;Remarking to a <i>gentleman</i>,&rdquo;
says Mr. Hutton, &ldquo;that I had gleaned some anecdotes
relative to Oswald, he asked me if I had seen Old Oswestry,
where, he assured me, the town had formerly stood.&nbsp; I
smiled, and answered him in the negative.&nbsp; He then told me,
&lsquo;that the town had <i>travelled</i> three quarters of a
mile to the place where it had taken up its present
abode.&rsquo;&nbsp; This belief, I found had been adopted by
others with whom I conversed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest sovereign possession of Oswestry, noted in the
Welsh historic page, was in the beginning of the fifth century,
as already referred to.&nbsp; Oswal, son of Cunedda Wledig, is
there represented to have been its first monarch.&nbsp; The Welsh
Chroniclers, however, furnish no details of his reign; and no
event connected with the town is subsequently recorded, till the
memorable one of King Oswald&rsquo;s attack upon the Mercian King
Penda, August 5th, A.D. 642.&nbsp; Oswald and Oswy <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>were sons of
Adelfrid, the seventh King of Northumberland.&nbsp; These young
Princes had been driven out of the kingdom of their father by
Cadwallawn, who had before been expelled from Wales, his rightful
possession, by Edwin.&nbsp; Oswald, after seventeen years&rsquo;
exile in Scotland, was restored to his kingdom by the overthrow
and death of Cadwallawn.&nbsp; During his exile Oswald is said to
have been baptized in a Christian church.&nbsp; He brought with
him from Scotland a Christian bishop, Aidan, who preached
Christianity to the people, and Oswald assisted him in his
ministrations.&nbsp; The young Northumbrian King appears to have
been zealous in the Christian cause, both in the pulpit and the
field.&nbsp; Penda was a pagan prince, and had united with
Cadwallawn in laying Northumbria waste.&nbsp; Oswald&rsquo;s
Christianity was not strong enough, it would seem, to subdue his
revenge against Penda.&nbsp; The two monarchs at length met, a
bloody conflict ensued, and Oswald was slain.&nbsp; The site of
the closing scene of this memorable battle is said to have been a
field called <i>Cae Nef</i> (Heaven&rsquo;s Field),
&ldquo;situated on the left of the turnpike road leading to the
Free School.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer from whom we quote mentions,
that &ldquo;Oswald approached with his army to what is called
Maes-y-llan, or Church Field, then open.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;About four hundred yards west of the church,&rdquo; he
adds, &ldquo;is a rising ground, where the battle began.&nbsp;
The assailant appears to have driven Penda&rsquo;s forces to a
field nearer the town, called <i>Cae Nef</i>.&nbsp; Here Oswald
fell.&rdquo;&nbsp; These minute particulars give increased
interest to the combat; but the writer does not state any
authority for the details.&nbsp; We suppose it must have been
merely traditionary.&nbsp; At the present time the sites of
<i>Cae Nef</i>, and <i>Church</i> or <i>Chapel Field</i>, are
well known to most of the inhabitants of the town.&nbsp;
Oswald&rsquo;s remains were first interred in the monastery of
Bradney, in Lincolnshire, and afterwards, in 909, removed to St.
Oswald&rsquo;s, in Gloucestershire.&nbsp; The memory of the
deceased King seems to have been held in great veneration, for
churches, in various parts of the kingdom, still bear his name,
as patron saint.&nbsp; <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Speed, in his &ldquo;<i>History of
Great Britaine</i>,&rdquo; with his accustomed quaintness and
minute graphic description, sums up Oswald&rsquo;s closing scene
in the following language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But as the sunne hath his shadow, and the
highest tide her ebbe, so <i>Oswald</i>, how holy soeuer, or
gouernment how good, had emulators that sought his life, and his
Countries mine: for wicked <i>Penda</i> the Pagan Mercian,
enuying the greatnesse that King <i>Oswald</i> bare, raised
warres against him, and at a place then called <i>Maserfeild</i>,
in <i>Shrop-shire</i>, in a bloudie and sore fought battle slew
him; and not therewith satisfied, in barbarous and brutish
immanitie, did teare him in peeces, the first day of August, and
yeere of Christ Iesus six hundred forty two, being the ninth of
his raigne, and the thirty eighth of his age: whereupon the said
place of his death is called to this day <i>Oswaldstree</i>, a
faire Market Towne in the same Countie.&nbsp; The dismembred
limmes of his body were first buried in the Monastery of
<i>Bradney</i>, in <i>Lincolnshire</i>, shrined with his standard
of Gold and Purple erected ouer his Tombe, at the industry and
cost of his neece <i>Offryd</i>, Queene of <i>Mercia</i>, wife
vnto king <i>Ethelred</i>, and daughter to <i>Oswyn</i> that
succeeded him.&nbsp; From hence his bones were afterwards
remooued to <i>Glocester</i>, and there in the north side of the
vpper end of the Quire in the Cathedrall Church, continueth a
faire Monument of him, with a Chapell set betwixt two pillers in
the same Church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the death of Oswald to 777, Oswestry is reported, as
already mentioned, to have been in undisputed possession of the
Britons.&nbsp; What its faithful history was during that long
period we are unable to state.&nbsp; If the Britons did really
occupy it, no event worthy of record seems to have
occurred.&nbsp; If the Britons were preserved in peace, no
chronicle is handed down to us of their social or industrial
habits within the halcyon time.&nbsp; Whether they improved their
land, instructed their minds in arts useful to their tribe, or
were sunk in ignorance, sloth, and selfishness, there is no voice
or pen to <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>inform us.&nbsp; Three centuries later than this period
the domestic architecture of the Cymry was in the lowest state of
rudeness.&nbsp; One of the regal mansions of Hywel Dda, their
great law-giver, was made of peeled rods; the people lived in
wattled huts; and a gentleman&rsquo;s hall was valued according
to the number of posts it contained.&nbsp; These were filled up
with wattled twigs and clay.&nbsp; The only notice we have of the
period is in the Welsh Chronicles, and from them we learn that
Cadwaladr (son of the Cadwallawn who was defeated and slain in a
battle with King Oswald, near Denisbourne, in Northumberland,)
the last of the Welsh Princes who assumed the title of Chief
Sovereign of Britain, reigned over the Britons from A.D. 634 to
703, and was succeeded by Idwal Iwrch, or the Roe.&nbsp; In one
of the Welsh Triads, Cadwaladr is called &ldquo;one of the three
canonized kings of Britain,&rdquo; for the protection which he
gave to the primitive Christians when dispossessed by the pagan
Saxons; and his long reign is mentioned as having been peaceable,
mainly in consequence, we are told, of his mother being sister to
Penda, the Mercian king.&nbsp; Rhodri Molwynog, a brave and
warlike prince, and grandson of Cadwaladr, succeeded to the
western part of Britain about the year 720, and was engaged in
constant hostilities with the Saxons until near the close of his
life, in 755.&nbsp; These dottings from Welsh history show that
the Britons had not peace within their borders during the long
period already mentioned, and that &ldquo;battles and
murders&rdquo; were still the constant theme and employment of
the Britons and Saxons.&nbsp; It is hardly probable that the
Britons possessed this district peaceably, and not unlikely that
they still had to fight for their lives and property, inch by
inch, and foot to foot.&nbsp; War, even in the present day, is
the curse of nations; it fosters animosities, engenders ignorance
and vice, and brutalizes man.&nbsp; What, then, must have been
the effect of constant wars and incursions upon the British
people by their invaders?&nbsp; The Britons had among them, about
this period, their great bard, <i>Llywarch Hen</i>, a man ranked
among <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the
wise bards of the Court of Arthur, and whose poetical effusions
display profound talent, if not genius, for so rude an age; but
we have no proofs that they profited much by his vigorous
instructions, although his life was lengthened out to one hundred
and fifty years.&nbsp; The art of printing was unknown in
Llywarch&rsquo;s days, otherwise his humanizing productions might
have wrought peace and harmony amongst both the oppressors and
the oppressed.</p>
<p>The period had now arrived when the sovereignty of the Britons
was so powerfully disputed that they were compelled to yield to
the cohort strength of the impetuous Offa, King of the
Mercians.&nbsp; Mercia was the largest of the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms, and London was its capital.&nbsp; Offa passed the
Severn with a mighty force, drove the Britons from their fertile
and lovely plains, and limited the princedom of Powys to the
western side of the celebrated ditch still known by the name of
<i>Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</i>.&nbsp; Offa enjoyed a victorious reign,
from the year 755 to 794.&nbsp; During that period the finest
part of Powys became a confirmed part of the Mercian territory,
and Shropshire was permanently annexed to England.&nbsp; Owen and
Blakeway, in their invaluable &ldquo;<i>History of
Shrewsbury</i>,&rdquo; remark, &ldquo;Though there can be no
doubt that the cession of Shropshire was obtained from the
British Prince (<i>Eliseg</i>, it is supposed,) only by the
military preponderance of the Saxon, yet it seems equally certain
that it must finally have been the subject of a pacific
negociation.&nbsp; A work of so much labour as Offa&rsquo;s Dyke,
evidently designed, according to his practice in other places, as
the line of demarkation between two kingdoms, could never have
been carried into execution without the concurrence of the
sovereign on each side of that boundary. * * * * The prince, thus
despoiled of the fairest portion of his dominions, retired to
Mathrafal, on the Vyrnwy, five miles beyond Welshpool, while
Pengwern, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>degraded from the dignity of a metropolis, passed under
the yoke of an English conqueror, and henceforth to be known by
the name of Shrewsbury, a name of Saxon origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</span>, called by the
Britons <i>Clawdd</i> <span class="smcap">Offa</span>, extended
nearly a hundred miles along the mountain border of Wales, from
the Clwydian hills to the mouth of the Wye.&nbsp; Part of the
Dyke may be traced at Brachy Hill, and Leintwardine, in
Herefordshire, continuing northward from Knighton, in
Radnorshire, over part of Shropshire, entering Montgomeryshire
between Bishop&rsquo;s Castle and Newtown.&nbsp; It again appears
in Shropshire, near Llanymynech, crosses Cern-y-bwch (the
Oswestry race-course), descends to the Ceiriog, near Chirk, where
it again enters Wales, and terminates in the parish of Mold,
beyond which no traces of it are discovered.&nbsp; Offa may have
imagined that the Clwydian hills, and the deep valley that lies
at their base, would serve as a continuance of the prohibitory
line.&nbsp; Pennant tells us, that in all parts the Dyke was
constructed on the Welsh side, and that there are numbers of
small artificial mounts, the sites of small forts along its
course.&nbsp; In the MS. &ldquo;<i>Historia Wallica</i>,&rdquo;
we are informed, that the work of forming this Dyke, forty feet
in height, occupied a numerous band of men, &ldquo;able and
accustomed to work in the fields,&rdquo; more than seven
years.&nbsp; This great line of demarcation answered but little
purpose as a line of defence, or even of boundary.&nbsp; The
Border Lands were still the scenes of sanguinary contests, and
superior force alone repelled the Britons.&nbsp; Severe laws were
enacted against any that should transgress the limits prescribed
by Offa; and one of these enactments declared, that &ldquo;the
Welshman who was found in arms on the Saxon side of the Dyke was
to lose his right hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; These laws, however, were
unheeded by the Britons.&nbsp; They deeply felt their injuries,
and concerted means of revenge, and, as they hoped,
emancipation.&nbsp; They formed an alliance with the kings of
Sussex and Northumberland, broke through the boundary, <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>attacked
Offa&rsquo;s camp, slew great numbers, and the Mercian king
himself narrowly escaped with a small remnant of his army.&nbsp;
On this disaster Offa retired into his own dominions, meditating
vengeance.&nbsp; Hostages having been given to him by the
Britons, a short time before, during a brief period of peace, he
now dealt out to them severe treatment, strictly confining them,
and selling, or reserving for perpetual slavery, their wives and
children.&nbsp; Still breathing destruction he marched into the
confines of Wales with a powerful army, but for years was
gallantly repelled by the Britons.&nbsp; At length the contending
forces met on Rhuddlan Marsh (now the scene of peaceful arts, the
Chester and Holyhead Railway passing over it), and the Britons,
under the command of Caradog, were entirely defeated with
terrific slaughter, their leader being slain in the
conflict.&nbsp; The fury of the Saxon prince did not cease with
victory.&nbsp; He savagely massacred the men, women, and children
who fell into his hands; and, according to tradition, the
remaining Britons, who had escaped the enemy&rsquo;s sword,
fleeing with haste over the marsh, perished in the waters by the
flowing of the tide.&nbsp; This tragedy has been carried down to
posterity by a plaintive Welsh melody, called <i>Morva
Rhuddlan</i>, the notes of which are amongst the most touching
and deeply-pathetic of Cambrian minstrelsy.</p>
<p>Having traced Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, it is necessary to describe
the course of <span class="smcap">Watt&rsquo;s Dyke</span>, as
the space between these two great lines of demarcation was deemed
neutral ground both by the Britons and their invaders, and
subsequently, during the Norman period, became part of what is
denominated the <span class="smcap">Marches</span>, although it
is difficult to define correctly the precise extent of territory
they occupied.&nbsp; Watt&rsquo;s Dyke is supposed by various
writers to have been constructed anterior to the time of
Offa.&nbsp; Its course is marked by Pennant as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It appears at Maesbury, in the parish of
Oswestry, and terminates at the river Dee, below Basingwerk
Abbey.&nbsp; The southern end of the line is lost in morassy
grounds; but was <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>probably continued to the river Severn.&nbsp; It extends
its course from Maesbury to the Mile Oak [on the old road from
Oswestry to Shrewsbury]; from thence through a field [now
belonging to Edward Williams, Esq., Solicitor, of Oswestry],
called <i>Maes-y-garreg-llwyd</i>, between two remarkable pillars
of unhewn stone [strongly resembling Druidic altar stones];
passes by the town [below the Shelf-bank&rsquo; Field], and from
thence to Old Oswestry, and by Pentreclawdd to Gobowen, the site
of a small fort called <i>Bryn-y-Castell</i>, in the parish of
Whittington; runs by Prys Henlle and Belmont; crosses the
Ceiriog, between Brynkinallt and Pont-y-blew Forge, and the Dee,
below Nant-y-Bela; from whence it passes through Wynnstay Park,
by another Pentreclawdd, to Erddig, where there was a strong fort
on its course; from Erddig it runs above Wrexham, near Melin
Puleston, by Dolydd, Maesgwyn, Rhos-dd&ucirc;, Croes-oneiras,
&amp;c.; goes over the Al&ucirc;n, and through the township of
Llai, to Rhydin, in the county of Flint, above which is
<i>Caer-estyn</i>, a British post; from hence it runs by Hope
church along the side of Molesdale, which it quits towards the
latter place, and turns to Mynydd Sychdyn, Monachlog, near
Northop, by Northop Mills, Bryn-Moel, Coed-y-Llys, Nant-y-Flint,
Cefn-y-Coed, through the Strand Fields, near Holywell, to its
termination below the Abbey of Basingwerk.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chester and Shrewsbury Railway intersects these two
ancient dykes.&nbsp; At the junction of the branch line to
Brymbo, Minera, &amp;c., the railway crosses Watt&rsquo;s Dyke,
and continues to run on the left side of it, travelling from
Chester, for about fourteen miles, until Gobowen is reached,
where the line again crosses the dyke; the superintendants of
modern improvements, especially railway engineers and
contractors, paying little if any deference to mere
antiquities.&nbsp; By this route the railway traveller passes a
considerable distance on the neutral ground, where alone, for
many years, the trade and commerce of the Britons, the Saxons,
and the Danes, were transacted.&nbsp; Offa&rsquo;s Dyke at Brymbo
is about two miles to the right, from Chester, and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>runs parallel
with the railway for about eighteen miles.&nbsp; Churchyard, in
his &ldquo;<i>Worthies of Wales</i>,&rdquo; thus chronicles, in
his quaint verse, the use to which the &ldquo;free ground&rdquo;
was applied in early days:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Within two miles, there is a famous
thing<br />
Called <span class="smcap">Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</span>, that
reacheth farre in lengthe;<br />
All kind of ware the Danes might thither bring;<br />
It was free ground, and called the Britaines&rsquo; strength.<br
/>
<span class="smcap">Watt&rsquo;s Dyke</span>, likewise, about the
same was set,<br />
Between which two, both Danes and Britaines met.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many years after Offa&rsquo;s memorable defeat of the
Britons on Rhuddlan Marsh, the history of the district conveys
but little information interesting in the present day.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wars, and rumours of wars,&rdquo; are the only topics on
which past historians have filled their pages in reference to
this period.&nbsp; Rhodri Mawr (Rhoderick the Great), one of the
most celebrated warriors and princes of Wales, succeeded to the
sovereignty of North Wales and Powys in 843.&nbsp; In the year of
his succession his territories were invaded by Berthred, King of
Mercia, whom he defeated with great loss.&nbsp; Rhodri left three
sons, and, according to the law of gavel-kind, he divided his
dominions among his children.&nbsp; His son Mervyn had the
principality of Powys, with the palace of Mathraval.&nbsp; His
three sons were called <i>y tri thywsog taleithiog</i>, or
diademed princes, from their wearing diadems of gold set with
precious stones; and Anarawd, his eldest son, received a yearly
tribute from the Prince of Powys.&nbsp; Contentions still
continued, and intestine divisions kept the Britons in as violent
commotion as if they were battling with their avowed enemies on
the border.&nbsp; Mervyn did not long enjoy his dominion, as he
was slain in 892 by his own subjects, headed by his brother
Cadell, who took possession of the throne.&nbsp; The reign of
Cadell was also brief, and his son Hywel Dda (Howel the Good)
succeeded him.&nbsp; The Welsh Justinian, as Hywel has been
called, died in 984, deservedly honoured by his subjects, and
leaving four sons, all of whom perished in the desolating wars to
which his country soon after fell a prey.</p>
<h3><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>The
Norman Period.</h3>
<p>Saxon dominance was now rapidly approaching to its close; and
the Britons were about to be exposed to the incursions of a new
body of invaders, under the usurpation of William, surnamed the
Conqueror.&nbsp; Bleddyn ab Cynvyn, with his brother, obtained in
1062 the sovereignty of North Wales and Powys, through the
influence of the Saxon King Edward.&nbsp; Bitter hostilities
subsequently occurred between Bleddyn and his kindred; at length
the succession to the whole principality passed from his
children, but Powys-land devolved to his sons, and came at length
entire to Meredydd, the eldest born, after the contentions and
slaughter incident in those days to such partitions.&nbsp;
Oswestry, we are told, was called <i>Trefred</i> (a contraction
of <i>Tre Meredydd</i>, Meredydd&rsquo;s Town), in honour of this
prince, but after his death the name was soon discontinued, and
the town resumed its former appellation of Oswald&rsquo;s-tree,
or Oswestry.&nbsp; His eldest son, Madog, inherited from his
father the tract known by the name of Powys Vadog, which
consisted, according to the division of the times, of five
cantrevs, or hundred townships; and these were subdivided into
fifteen commots, or cwmwds:</p>

<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>To
Madog is assigned the honour of erecting the Castle of
Oswestry.&nbsp; Whether he is entitled to this distinction it
would be difficult now to prove.&nbsp; Welsh historians assert,
that he built also the Castles of Overton (Flintshire) and
Caereinion, and that in the former, which received the additional
name of Madog, he resided.&nbsp; Powell says of him, that he was
&ldquo;ever the King of England&rsquo;s friend, and was one that
feared <span class="smcap">God</span>, and relieved the
poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madog married Susanna, daughter of Grufydd ab
Cynan, Prince of North Wales, by whom he had two sons, Grufydd
Maelor and Owain ab Madog.&nbsp; To the first he gave the two
Maelors, Yale, Hopedale, Nanheudwy, Mochnant-is-Rhaiadr, &amp;c.:
to Owain, the land of Mechain-is-Coed; and to his natural son,
Owain Brogyntyn, a nobleman of distinguished talents, he granted
the lordships of Edeirnion and Dinmael.&nbsp; The last-named
Owain resided at Brogyntyn, near Oswestry, now called Porkington,
whence he assumed his surname.&nbsp; His dagger and cup are still
preserved at R&ucirc;g: and many families in Merionethshire and
Denbighshire are directly descended from him.&nbsp; Madog&rsquo;s
second wife was Maud Verdon, an Englishwoman of noble
lineage.&nbsp; He died in 1159 at Winchester, whence his body was
conveyed to Meivod, in Montgomeryshire, where it was deposited in
the Church of St. Mary, which he himself had built some years
before.&nbsp; His widow is stated to have been married to William
Fitz-Alan, Lord of Clun, and he, in right of his wife, obtained
the town and castle of Oswestry.&nbsp; Fitz-Alan was a descendant
of Alan, one of the companions of the Conqueror, and was the
first of his name who bore the title of &ldquo;Baron of
Oswaldestre.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alan was progenitor of the entire noble
family which from him derived the name of Fitz-Alan, and for many
succeeding centuries were the most distinguished personages in
Shropshire.&nbsp; From this powerful race is descended the
present Duke of Norfolk, who holds the title of &ldquo;Baron of
Oswaldestre,&rdquo; in addition to his other patrician
honours.&nbsp; His Grace&rsquo;s ancestor, Thomas, Duke of
Norfolk, married Lady Mary, daughter of Henry, <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the last Earl
of Arundel named Fitz-Alan, 13th Elizabeth, when the barony of
&ldquo;Oswaldestre&rdquo; was conveyed to the Duke.</p>
<p>The Norman conquest was &ldquo;a heavy blow and great
discouragement&rdquo; to the impetuous Britons.&nbsp; During that
eventful period almost the whole of Shropshire was parcelled out,
and bestowed by William the Conqueror on his kinsman, Roger de
Montgomery, as a reward for his great military services in the
conquest.&nbsp; The Earl of Shrewsbury, whilst thus taking
possession of Powys, among his other newly-acquired lands,
brought under his subjection the town and castle of Trefaldwyn,
(from Baldwin, Montgomery&rsquo;s lieutenant,) which fortress he
strongly fortified, and afterwards called it after his own family
name.&nbsp; Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, (the founder of the
Grosvenor family,) likewise did homage for Englefield and
Rh&ucirc;voniog, with the country extending along the sea shore
from Chester to the waters of Conway.&nbsp; Ralph Mortimer did
the same for the territory of Elvel; as did Hugh de Lacie for the
lands of Eulas; and Eustace Cruer for Mold and Hopedale.&nbsp;
Brady relates out of Domesday, that William the Conqueror granted
to Hugh Lupus North Wales in farm, at the rent of &pound;40 per
annum, besides Rhos and Rh&ucirc;voniog.&nbsp; These Norman
Barons erected fortresses on their lands, and, so far as they
were able, settled in them English and Norman defenders.&nbsp; In
a MS., relating to the Welsh Marches, from the library of the
late Philip Lloyd Fletcher, Esq., of Gwernhaylod, in Flintshire,
it is stated &ldquo;that about this time, Bristol, Gloucester,
Worcester, Shrewsbury, and Chester were rebuilt and fortified,
and formed a line of military posts upon the
frontiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the last asylum of the Welsh was
invested on almost every side, or broken into by their
enemies.&nbsp; The kingdom of North Wales, reduced to the island
of Anglesey, to Merioneth and Caernarvonshire, and to part of the
present counties of Denbigh and Cardigan, still preserved the
national character and <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>importance.&nbsp; The natives of
Wales, aided by the virtue and courage of their Princes, became
more formidable than ever to the English; and at times, as they
acquired union with additional vigour from despair, their
invaders, instead of being able to make new conquests, held those
which they had already obtained by a precarious tenure.&nbsp;
William&rsquo;s policy, in giving to his barons the power to make
such conquests in Wales as they were able, led to the erection of
the Marches Lordships, of which Oswestry formed a part.&nbsp;
These lordships consisted of more than a hundred petty
sovereignties, and were the fruitful source of innumerable
disorders, till their partial suppression in the reign of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; Pennant says, that William&rsquo;s design was, in
establishing these seignories and jurisdictions, to give to those
whom he had brought over to England the power of providing for
themselves, and to reduce, at the same time, the opposition of
the Welsh people.&nbsp; The precise extent of the Marches
Lordships it is difficult, as we have already said, to
define.&nbsp; During the Saxon period the Severn was considered
the ancient boundary between England and Wales.&nbsp; The lands
conquered by Offa on the western side of that river were annexed
to Mercia, and afterwards incorporated with the monarchy by
Alfred the Great.&nbsp; The term <i>Marches</i> signifies
generally the limits or space between England and Wales, of which
the western part of Shropshire, Oswestry included, formed a
principal portion.&nbsp; Of the Norman Barons, besides the first
Earl of Shrewsbury, who did homage for royal grants of territory,
were Fitzalan for Oswestry and Clun; Fitz-Gwarine for
Whittington; and Roger le Strange for Ellesmere.&nbsp; The tenure
by which the <i>Baronies Marches</i> were held, was,
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;in case of war the lords should send to the
army a certain number of their vassals; that they should garrison
their respective castles, and keep the Welsh in subjection.&nbsp;
In return for these services the lords had an arbitrary and
despotic power in their own domains.&nbsp; They had the power of
life and death, in their respective courts, in all cases except
those of high treason.&nbsp; <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>In every frontier manor a gallows was
erected; if any Welshman passed the boundary line fixed between
the two countries, he was immediately seized and hanged.&nbsp;
Every town within the Marches had a horseman armed with a spear,
who was maintained for the express purpose of taking these
offenders.&nbsp; If any Englishman was caught on the Welsh side
of the line, he suffered a similar fate.&nbsp; The Welsh
considered everything that they could steal from their English
neighbours as lawful prize.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the conquest of Wales by Edward I. the Baronies Marches
were continued, but under regulations somewhat different from the
former.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward IV. they were governed by a
Lord President and Council, consisting of the Chief Justice of
Chester, and three Justices of Wales.&nbsp; In cases of emergency
other parties were called in.&nbsp; By a statute passed in the
reign of Henry VIII. the principality and dominion of Wales
became formally annexed to England; and all the Welsh laws, and
most of their peculiar customs and tenures, were by this statute
entirely abolished.&nbsp; By this statute also four new counties
were formed, Brecknockshire, Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, and
Radnorshire.&nbsp; The Marches became annexed partly to England,
and partly to the new counties of Wales.&nbsp; The President and
Council of the Marches were however allowed to continue as
before, and their general court was held at Ludlow.&nbsp; A
statute was passed in the reign of William III., by which the
government of the entire principality was divided between two
peers of the realm, on whom was conferred the title of Lords
Lieutenant of North and South Wales.&nbsp; From that period the
Lordship Marches were entirely abolished.</p>
<p>There is another salient point in the history of Wales which
it will not be inappropriate here to mention.&nbsp; Many of our
readers have heard or read of the Royal Tribes of Wales.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The five regal Tribes, and the respective
representative of each, were considered as of royal blood.&nbsp;
The fifteen common Tribes, all of North Wales, and the respective
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>representative of each, formed the nobility, were lords
of distinct districts, and bore some hereditary office in the
palace.&nbsp; Grufydd ab Cynan, Prince of North Wales, Rhys ab
Tewdwr, of South Wales, and Bleddyn ab Cynvyn, of Powys,
regulated both these classes, but did not create them; as many of
the persons, placed at their head, lived before their times, and
some after.&nbsp; Their precedence, as it stands, is very
uncertain, and not governed by dates; the last of them were
created by Davydd ab Owain Gwynedd, who began his reign in
1169.&nbsp; We are left ignorant of the form by which they were
called to this rank.&nbsp; Mr. Vaughan, of Hengwrt, informs us
that Grufydd ab Cynan, Rhys ab Tewdwr, and Bleddyn ab Cynvyn made
diligent search after the arms, ensigns, and pedigrees of their
ancestors, the nobility and kings of the Britons.&nbsp; What they
discovered by their pains in any paper or records, was afterwards
by the Bards digested, and put into books, and they ordained five
Royal Tribes, there being only three before, from whom their
posterity to this day can derive themselves, and also fifteen
special Tribes, of whom the gentry of North Wales are for the
most part descended!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen from the foregoing pages that we have
abstained from all minute detail in our description of the
continued struggles for mastery between the Welsh and their own
kindred, as well as of the strife for power and dominion between
the Cambrian princes and their foreign invaders.&nbsp; These
scenes in the history of Wales are nothing more, to use the
eloquent language of Warrington, than &ldquo;a recital of
reciprocal inroads and injuries&mdash;a series of objects
unvaried and of little importance, which pass the eye in a
succession of cold delineations, like the evanescent figures
produced by the <i>camera obscura</i>.&nbsp; The characters and
events are not brought distinctly into view, nor are they
sufficiently explained, to enable the historian to judge of their
proportions, their beauty, or defects; whence he can neither
develope the principles of action, nor trace the connection of
causes with effects, by <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>leading incidents, or by the general
springs which govern human affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The story
of our country under its native princes,&rdquo; observes another
impartial writer on Welsh history, &ldquo;is a wretched calendar
of crimes, of usurpations, and family assassinations; and in this
dismal detail we should believe ourselves rather on the Bosphorus
than the banks of the Dee.&rdquo;&nbsp; The British or Welsh
rulers had doubtless much to complain of against their Roman,
Saxon, and Norman invaders; but their own conduct towards their
own people&mdash;to those who by affinity claimed their
protection and regard&mdash;was quite as guilty as that of their
foreign foes.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire reign of Henry I. we read in the Welsh
annals of nothing but &ldquo;a series of retaliated injuries
arising in regular succession; evils naturally springing from the
passions, where they usurp the sword of justice.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Henry died about the year 1135, and Stephen succeeded to the
English throne, and was soon embarked in a sea of troubles.&nbsp;
Engaged in continual hostilities, and in supporting a doubtful
title, he prudently concluded a peace with the Welsh, and allowed
them to retain the territories they had lately recovered, free of
homage or tribute.&nbsp; The incidents of Stephen&rsquo;s reign
were marked by no feature of national interest; and the only
reference made to it in connection with this district is William
Fitz-Alan&rsquo;s espousal of the claim made by the Empress Maud
to the English crown.&nbsp; His union with other noblemen, to
dethrone Stephen, exposed him to danger, and he was compelled to
leave the kingdom, abandoning his lands and other property to the
incensed monarch.&nbsp; Whilst an exile from England he remained
faithful to the interests of the Empress; and on his return to
this country on the death of Stephen, and the accession to the
throne of Henry II., he reaped the reward of his spirit and
fidelity, by receiving back all his forfeited honours and
estates, including the Castles of Oswestry and Clun.&nbsp; Of
Oswestry Castle we shall speak particularly in subsequent
pages.&nbsp; Of Clun we may at <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>present say, that it remained in the
direct line of William Fitz-Alan down to the reign of Queen
Elizabeth, when the last Earl died.&nbsp; By the marriage of Mary
Fitz-Alan with Philip Howard, the son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk,
it became vested in that noble family.&nbsp; From them it passed
to the Walcotts, and afterwards, by purchase, to Lord Clive, in
whose family it continues.&nbsp; The Duke of Norfolk still
retains the title of &ldquo;Baron of Clun,&rdquo; as well as that
of &ldquo;Baron of Oswaldestre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry was an inveterate and formidable enemy to the interests
of Wales.&nbsp; He speedily employed his utmost force in
attempting to subjugate the Cambrian people; and it is recorded
of Madog ab Meredydd, Prince of Powys, who had united with the
enemies of his country, that he incited the English king to an
invasion of North Wales.&nbsp; Henry listened to the
solicitations of the Powysian prince, and eagerly exerted every
means for the conquest of the country.&nbsp; He quickly raised a
powerful army, and marched without delay into North Wales.&nbsp;
Mathew Paris states that the levy of Henry, raised at this time,
amounted to 30,000 men.&nbsp; Owain Gwynedd, in this campaign,
gallantly led the Welsh, and in one of the actions, at <i>Coed
Euloe</i>, near Hawarden, Flintshire, the monarch himself, who
had encamped near the field of battle, escaped from the hands of
the Welsh with the greatest difficulty.&nbsp; The English forces,
having been strengthened, pursued the Welsh, and at length Prince
Owain, fearful that his army would perish for want of provisions,
concluded a peace with the King of England.&nbsp; He himself and
his chieftains submitted to do homage to Henry, and to yield up
the castles and districts in North Wales which, in the last
reign, had been obtained from the English.&nbsp; Lord Lyttleton
tells us, that to complete this humiliating position, Owain was
obliged to deliver up two of his sons as pledges of his future
obedience.&nbsp; The year after this important event a general <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>peace took
place between England and Wales; the princes and all the
chieftains of South Wales repaired to the court of England, where
Henry granted peace, on the Welsh doing homage for their own
territories, and formally ceding to him the districts recovered
from the English in the last reign.&nbsp; This peaceful state of
things was but of short duration.&nbsp; Rhys, the son of Grufydd
ab Rhys, immediate heir to the sovereign power of South Wales,
having been outraged by several English lords, threw off his
allegiance, commenced a revolt, and rallied around him a numerous
force, which perplexed and baffled the English monarch.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards, fired by the gallant example of Rhys, the
Prince of North Wales (Owain Gwynedd), and all his sons, his
brother Cadwaladr, and the chieftains of Powys, united with him,
in the endeavour to regain their independence and honour.&nbsp;
After some slight skirmishes with the Welsh, Henry gathered
together a formidable force, with which he marched into Powys,
breathing slaughter and extermination against the
inhabitants.&nbsp; All the historical writers, in describing this
fearful onslaught, admit that few events of ancient times were
more deeply stained with the blood of innocence.&nbsp; The
English army, formed of the choicest troops, from Normandy,
Anjou, Flanders, Brittany, and other territories which Henry
possessed in France, entered the Welsh confines at Oswestry,
where it was encamped for some time.&nbsp; The forces of North
Wales were collected under the command of Owain Gwynedd and his
brother Cadwaladr; the army of South Wales was headed by the
chivalrous Rhys ab Grufydd; and the men of Powys were led by
Owain Cyveiliog, and the sons of Madog ab Meredydd.&nbsp; The
combined forces of the Welsh assembled at Corwen, where they
awaited the approach of the English.&nbsp; Henry, burning with
ardour to attack the enemy, marched his army to the banks of the
Ceiriog, near the present village of Chirk, and at once ordered
that the woods on each side of the river be cut down, to prevent
ambuscades and sudden approaches of the enemy.&nbsp; It is
related by some writers, that <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>on the passage of the Ceiriog Henry
was in imminent danger of losing his life: attempting to force a
bridge, an arrow aimed at him by the hand of a Welshman must
inevitably have pierced his body, if Hubert de St. Clare,
Constable of Colchester, perceiving the danger, had not in a
moment sprang before his sovereign and received it into his own
bosom, and thereby met with his death-wound.&nbsp; Whilst the
English soldiers were employed in felling the woods, a detachment
of the Welsh forces forded the river, and suddenly attacked the
van of Henry&rsquo;s army, composed of pikemen, considered to be
the most daring and gallant portion of his soldiers.&nbsp; A
fierce battle ensued; many were killed on both sides, but at
length Henry gained the passage, and advanced onward to the
Berwyn mountains, to recruit his troops.&nbsp; There he remained
in camp for several days.&nbsp; The Welsh were posted on the
mountain-heights opposite, watching with lynx-eyed care every
movement of the enemy.&nbsp; They succeeded in cutting off his
supplies, and his army was reduced to extreme distress and
privation, for want of food for man and horse.&nbsp; To increase
his difficulties, sudden and heavy rains fell, which rendered the
country on the Berwyn side so slippery and dangerous, that
neither men nor horses could stand on their feet.&nbsp; Torrents
of water, from the incessant rains, poured down from the
mountains into the vale where Henry was encamped; and, unable to
maintain his ground amidst all these unexpected disasters, he
retired, with great loss of men, and, what was more annoying to
his vaunting spirit, with defeat and disgrace.&nbsp; Fired with
revenge, and urged by the barbarism which ever marks the tyrant,
he commanded that the eyes of all the hostages which had been
placed in his hands should be put out.&nbsp; The two sons of Rhys
ab Grufydd, Prince of South Wales, and the two sons also of Owain
Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales, became the unfortunate victims of
Henry&rsquo;s cruelty.&nbsp; Holinshead, in his Chronicles, tells
us, that besides these young chieftains, the atrocious monarch
caused the sons and daughters of several Welsh lords to be
treated with the same severity; ordering <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the eyes of
the young striplings to be pecked out of their heads, and the
ears of the gentlewomen to be stuffed.</p>
<p>In the annals of Wales this battle is ranked among the
brightest achievements of the Welsh, in their long-continued
struggles for liberty.&nbsp; The site is known by the mournful
designation of <i>Adwy&rsquo;r Beddau</i>, or the Pass of the
Graves.&nbsp; The conflict is called in most of the ancient
books, &ldquo;<i>The Battle of Crogen</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yorke
observes, &ldquo;it has been erroneously said that the term
Crogen was used in contempt and derision of the Welsh; but that
was not the truth: the English meant to express by it animosity,
and the desire of revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Many of the
English,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;were slain, and buried in
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, below Chirk Castle, and the part so filled up
is to be seen, and forms a passage over it, called to this day
<i>Adwy&rsquo;r Beddau</i>, or the Pass of the
Graves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late Mr. William Price, in an annotated
edition of his &ldquo;History of Oswestry,&rdquo; published in
1815, has the following note on the Battle of Crogen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Owain Gwynedd slept at Tyn-y-Rhos, the
present residence of Richard Phillips, Esq., who has still in
preservation the bedstead he at that time lay upon.&nbsp;
Likewise a Deed or Lease of a piece of land, of five acres, for
2s. 8d. per year; with a cock and hen at Christmas, and a man a
day in the harvest; which still preserves the name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning for a moment to the civil government of Oswestry, it
may be mentioned that in the reign of Henry II, the first Charter
was granted to Oswestry, by William, Earl of Arundel.&nbsp; The
Welsh called it &ldquo;<i>Siarter Cwtta</i>,&rdquo; the Short
Charter.&nbsp; It was a Charter of protection, of which there
were many granted about this period.&nbsp; It states, &ldquo;I
have received in protection my Burgesses of Blanc-Minster.&nbsp;
Richard de Chambre was Constable of White-Minster.&nbsp; Thomas
de Rossall held Rossall, of John Fitz-Alan, in chief, of one
knight&rsquo;s fee at White-Minster.&rdquo;&nbsp; Guto (y Glyn),
an excellent poet who flourished from 1430 to 1460, a native of
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Llangollen, and domestic bard to the Abbot of
Llanegwestl, or Valle Crucis, near that romantic town, speaks of
White-Minster in his days.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I know not of
any Convent of Monks superior to White-Minster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the year 1188, William Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, gave
a sumptous banquet in the Castle of Oswestry, to Giraldus
Cambrensis, and Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, on their
return from Wales, the bleak and barren mountains of which they
had just travelled over, in an attempt to incite the people to
the intended Crusade to the Holy Land.&nbsp; Giraldus seems to
have considered that the entertainment given by the Norman Earl
was too luxurious for saintly personages.&nbsp; He speaks,
however, with much complacency of the comfortable accommodations
provided for him and the Archbishop at Shrewsbury, whither they
repaired from this town.&nbsp; &ldquo;From Oswestry,&rdquo; says
he, &ldquo;that Prelate and his retinue came after Easter (1188)
to Slopesbury, where they remained some days to recruit and
refresh themselves, and many assumed the cross in obedience to
the precepts of the Archbishop, and the gracious sermon of the
Archdeacon of St. David&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here also they
excommunicated Oen de Cevelioc (Owain Cyveiliog, Prince of
Powys), because he alone of all the Welsh princes, had not
advanced to meet the Archbishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The visit of
Giraldus and Baldwin to Oswestry might have been induced by a
two-fold motive, namely, to partake of the princely hospitality
of Fitz-Alan, in his baronial castle, and to hold &ldquo;ghostly
communication&rdquo; with Regner, Bishop of St. Asaph, who at
this period resided in Oswaldestre.</p>
<p>The succeeding portion of Henry II&rsquo;s long reign was
largely occupied with plans and movements to subdue the Welsh
princes and their people.&nbsp; After repeated struggles, the
English monarch saw, with exulting spirit, that he had reduced
Cambrian independence to a bye-word of contempt, by seducing them
from patriotism and virtue, and rendering <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>them a
disunited and improvident people.&nbsp; When he had accomplished
this signal victory over them, and hoped to enjoy further years
of sovereign power in comparative ease and tranquillity, the fate
even of monarchs was dealt out to him.&nbsp; His mortal career
was ended, and he was &ldquo;gathered to his
fathers:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The glories of our blood and state are
shadows, not substantial things;<br />
There is no armour against fate; Death lays his icy hand on
kings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry was succeeded by Richard, his son, surnamed
C&oelig;ur-de-Lion, whose reign continued for about ten years,
when he was slain at the siege of Chalons, in France, and John,
his brother, ascended the throne.&nbsp; During Richard&rsquo;s
monarchy the town of Oswestry was not marked by any event worthy
the record of the contemporary historian.</p>
<p>The reign of John was distinguished by strong enmity to the
Welsh.&nbsp; In 1211 he assembled a large army at Oswestry, and
was there joined by many of the Welsh Chieftains, his vassals,
with whom he marched to Chester; resolving to exterminate the
people of North Wales.&nbsp; It is revolting to trace the history
of this feeble-minded and capricious king.&nbsp; His reckless
attacks upon Wales, and his inveterate quarrel with his
son-in-law, Prince Llywelyn ab Jorwerth, added to his troubles,
and probably hastened his end.&nbsp; As a last effort against
Wales, resenting Llywelyn&rsquo;s stern defence of Cambrian
independence, John demolished the castles of Radnor and Hay; and
then, proceeding to the Marches, he set fire to Oswestry Castle,
then under the governorship of John Fitz-Alan, (who had united
with the barons of England in renouncing allegiance to the
English Monarch, on his refusal to confirm their constitutional
rights,) and burnt it to the ground.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry III. John Fitz-Alan, who was reconciled
to the king, procured for his Manor of Blanc-Minster <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the grant of
a Fair on the eve, the day, and the day after St. Andrew&rsquo;s
feast.&nbsp; The Bailiffs were also made clerks of the market,
with privilege to imprison any person detected in forestalling;
for which they were paid twenty marks as a consideration.&nbsp;
These petty officers, &ldquo;dressed in a little brief
authority,&rdquo; abused their power, and gave occasion to
frequent remonstrances from the inhabitants.&nbsp; Powel, who
seems to have paid great deference to &ldquo;the powers that
be,&rdquo; concludes, not very logically, we think, that it was
&ldquo;no wonder that so many of the grievances which the Welsh
so much complained of to Edward I. should originate from this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The historic facts recorded subsequent to this period are
brief and meagre.&nbsp; We are told that in 1233 Oswestry was
again destroyed by fire.&nbsp; Llywelyn ab Jorwerth had just made
an inroad into the county of Brecknock, destroying all the towns
and fortresses belonging to that territory; he then invested the
castle, lay before it a month, raised the siege, finding his
efforts to be fruitless, set fire to the town, and pursued his
way to the Marches.&nbsp; Conflagration and ruin marked his
progress: he burnt the town of Clun, in Salop, demolished Redde
Castle, in Powys, and laid Oswestry in ashes.&nbsp; A few months
afterwards, Llywelyn and Lord Pembroke, having joined their
forces, made another inroad into the English Marches, and having
rendered all that country a scene of devastation, they finished
their fiery career by laying part of the town of Shrewsbury
(Frankwell, it is supposed,) in ashes.</p>
<p>Early in the reign of Edward I. that monarch was intent on
bowing the stubborn neck of Llywelyn ab Grufydd (the last native
sovereign Prince of Wales).&nbsp; Llywelyn was refractory, and
ambitious to maintain his order.&nbsp; Edward summoned him to a
parliament in London, but Llywelyn refused to comply with the
royal command.&nbsp; In reply, he offered (Oct. 14,
1276&ndash;7,) to repair to Montgomery, or to &ldquo;the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>White
Monastery of John Fitz-Alan,&rdquo; as Oswestry was then called,
but declined a journey to the metropolis of England.&nbsp; On the
receipt of this answer, by which Edward, resolute to exact a
personal obedience, was, or affected to be, greatly enraged, the
Parliament immediately condemned Llywelyn as a rebel, for his
non-appearance.&nbsp; The melancholy end of the Welsh prince is
well known.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says an elegant historian,
&ldquo;the valour of Llywelyn, his talents, and his patriotism,
had been exhibited upon a more splendid theatre,&mdash;on the
plains of Marathon, or in the straits of
Thermopyl&aelig;,&mdash;his name would have been recorded in the
classic page, and his memory revered, as an illustrious hero, and
as a gallant assertor of the rights of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward did not confine his attention to Wales only, but
extended it to the Borders, and included in his eagle-eyed glance
the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Provision was made,&rdquo;
says Pennant, &ldquo;against future insults; for in the reign of
Edward I. the town (Oswestry) was surrounded with walls.&nbsp;
This happened when that politic monarch meditated the conquest of
Wales; he therefore thought proper to secure this town, one of
the keys of the country, with proper defence.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
commenced the erection of the walls in 1277.&nbsp; They are said
to have been about a mile in circumference, with an intrenchment
on the outside, which could be filled with water from the
numerous streams in the vicinity.&nbsp; Edward&rsquo;s order to
put Oswestry into a state of defence issued from
Shrewsbury&mdash;the seat of his government for several
months&mdash;and his letters patent, directed to the Bailiffs and
Burgesses of the ancient town, are worthy of record, as they show
the mode in which taxation was levied in early days.&nbsp; This
curious document is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of the Murage of Oswaldestre.&nbsp; The
King to the Bailiffs and Burgesses, and the other good men of
Oswaldestre greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know ye that we have granted in aid of enclosing our <a

And we therefore command that ye take the said custom to the end
of the term aforesaid, but the term of the said twenty years

</blockquote>
<p>Pennant states that the walls were begun in the sixth of
Edward I., and that &ldquo;the murage or toll was granted on the
inhabitants of the county, which lasted for six years, in which
time it may be supposed the walls were completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archbishop Peckham visited Oswestry, June 12, 1284.&nbsp; He
was received with great respect by Anian, Bishop of St. Asaph,
the clergy, and others.&nbsp; Anian obtained from the king a
confirmation of the rights and privileges of his church, and
received from John Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, and Baron of
Oswestry and Clun, the grant to his church of one hundred acres
of land at St. Martins, paying yearly at Midsummer, for ever, a
pair of gilt spurs; with the condition, that neither the bishop
nor his successors should alienate the same.&nbsp; This grant is
dated at <i>Album Monasterium</i>, 1271.&nbsp; Richard, son of
the said John Fitz-Alan, afterwards confirmed it, and also gave
forty-five acres more, with the manor-house belonging
thereto.&nbsp; Anian had a long dispute at Rome respecting the
placing of a vicar in Blanc-Monasterium, the tithes of which his
predecessor had given to the Abbey of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The issue
was, that the abbot, for the peaceable enjoyment of his tithes,
gave the whole of his lands at St. Martins, upon paying two
<i>Welsh knives</i> yearly.&nbsp; These said knives, if now
produced at Sheffield, would doubtless disturb the risible
faculties of the keen knife-manufacturers there.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Edward
II. was much annoyed and harassed in the latter part of his
reign, partly from his want of fidelity to many of his most
distinguished nobles, the two Mortimers, uncle and nephew, among
their number.&nbsp; A revolution broke out against the king, in
1325, concocted, it is said, by the queen and her favourite,
Roger Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore, in which the French monarch also
took part.&nbsp; A strong feeling for and against Edward was
manifested in Shrewsbury, where the Mortimers were well
known.&nbsp; Edmund, Earl of Arundel, was one of the few peers
who had preserved their loyalty to the crown.&nbsp; He assembled
a multitude of his Welsh tenantry at Oswestry, with a view of
seizing Shrewsbury for the king.&nbsp; Arundel was, however,
apprehended near Shrewsbury, with certain of his adherents, after
an obstinate struggle.&nbsp; The Earl was taken from that town to
Hereford, where he expiated his loyalty on the scaffold.&nbsp;
For this &ldquo;service&rdquo; the &ldquo;good men of
Salop&rdquo; had all the goods and chattels found upon him.&nbsp;
After his execution, the queen, to show her attachment to her
paramour, Lord Mortimer, obtained the Castle of Oswestry for that
favourite.&nbsp; In 1324, Edmund, Earl of Arundel, granted two
shops in Leg-street, to the burgesses of Oswestry for ever, on
payment of 13s. 4d. yearly.&nbsp; This grant is witnessed by
&ldquo;Lord Richard, Abbot of Haggemon,&rdquo; and others, and
&ldquo;dated at Oswaldestre, on the feast of St. Michael, in the
18th year of the reign of King Edward, the son of King
Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward III.&rsquo;s reign was long and glorious.&nbsp; It was
distinguished by the ever-memorable battle of Cressy.&nbsp; Part
of the inhabitants of this town doubtless contributed to the
victory thus obtained; for in 1346 the king directed Richard
Fitz-Alan to raise two hundred of his vassals from Oswestry and
Clun, to attend him in the French wars.</p>
<p>In 1397 Richard, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, was attainted and
executed, when Richard II. seized all his lands and <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>manors, and
granted them to William le Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire.&nbsp; In
the <i>Historia Regum Angli&aelig;</i> we find the following bit
of superstition entertained at this period.&nbsp; On this
occasion the Earl of Arundel must, of course, have deeply
regretted his contempt of the marvellous stone of which John
Ross, the Antiquary, of Warwick, writes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
earl,&rdquo; says this grave author, &ldquo;kept a raven in his
court; and one day, as he was playing at chess in the garden, the
bird,&rdquo; or, as Ross suggests, &ldquo;a spirit in that form,
brought up (<i>eructavit</i>) a stone having the virtue of
invisibility.&nbsp; The earl set no value upon it, contrary to
the advice of his nobles; and soon after, being arrested by
strong hand, he was committed to ward, and finally
beheaded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king, having put down all opposition to certain measures
which he was resolved to carry, by the execution of Arundel, and
the murder of his uncle of Gloucester, adjourned his Parliament
at Westminster to Shrewsbury, and from thence to Oswestry.&nbsp;
An apprehension of tumult among the Earl of Arundel&rsquo;s
tenantry in this county, from his violent death, and the seizure
of his estates, was probably the reason for making both
Shrewsbury and Oswestry the scene of that national
assembly.&nbsp; The Parliament met at Shrewsbury Jan. 29,
1397&ndash;8, and was designated <span class="smcap">The Great
Parliament</span>.&nbsp; In this regal visit he displayed great
magnificence, and entertained the members with a sumptuous
banquet, he appearing among the people in his costly royal
robes.&nbsp; Whilst in Shrewsbury Richard made Chester a
Principality, and annexed to it the Castle of Holt, the lordship
of Bromfield and Yale, Chirkland, and various other places in
Wales and on the Borders.&nbsp; During the proceedings in
Parliament it was ascertained that deadly hatred subsisted
between the Dukes of Hereford and Norfolk.&nbsp; These noblemen
had been jointly concerned in the impeachment of Arundel and his
fellow-sufferers, at Westminster.&nbsp; Norfolk, touched by
remorse for his share in the ruin of a patriotic peer, or
desirous <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>of ensnaring his late confederate, who had charged
Norfolk with using words disrespectful to the king, fell into
open quarrel with Hereford, who made the matter a subject of
public accusation in the Parliament against his antagonist.&nbsp;
The king, unwilling that any discourse about himself should be
made the subject of open discussion, suddenly closed the
proceedings of Parliament, and adjourned to Oswestry.&nbsp; In
the assembly there the dispute between the two Dukes was
recommenced, and the king resolved that it should be ended by a
duel between the belligerent parties at Coventry.&nbsp; The
combat did not take place, as the Duke of Norfolk refused to
fight; upon which Norfolk was banished from the kingdom for ever,
and Hereford for ten years.&nbsp; As a mark of the royal favour,
Richard granted, before the Parliament closed, the first Charter
conferred upon Oswestry, by which the town was incorporated by
the name of &ldquo;<i>The Bailiffs and Burgesses of Oswestry</i>,
<i>infra Palatinatum Cestri&aelig; in Marchia inter Angliam et
Walliam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Charter, which was founded upon the
one granted just before at Shrewsbury, exempted the Burgesses
from all contributions and exactions whatsoever, throughout the
kingdom, the city of London excepted.&nbsp; It bears date, August
14, 1399.</p>
<p>The close of Richard&rsquo;s kingly rule was near.&nbsp; His
love of idle show and magnificence, his delight in popular
applause, the buzzing about him of parasites and flatterers, and
his indulgence in pleasures, were followed by a brief scene of
bitter existence, which ended in degrading humiliation and
painful death.&nbsp; The eyes of Henry of Lancaster, Duke of
Hereford, had long been directed towards the throne, and he
actively employed his agents to place him upon it.&nbsp; The
classic historians of Shrewsbury assure us that, either from the
disgust occasioned by outrages perpetrated upon the Burgesses, by
Richard&rsquo;s body-guard, or disorderly multitudes brought into
the town during the sittings of his Parliament, &ldquo;it is
certain that the revolution which placed Henry of Lancaster on
the <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>throne
had the entire concurrence of the inhabitants of these parts
(Shropshire).&nbsp; When the Duke proceeded into Wales to
circumvent the unhappy Richard, he passed through Ludlow and
Shrewsbury, and was joined here (Shrewsbury) by the Lords Scales
and Bardolph, Sir Robert and Sir John Legh, and other gentlemen
of Cheshire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard, after suffering much
indignity, was secured a prisoner in Flint Castle, by the great
conspirator Lancaster, and from thence was led in the
Duke&rsquo;s train to Chester.&nbsp; Here Bolingbroke delivered
the subdued monarch to the Duke of Gloucester and Thomas, Earl of
Arundel, saying, &ldquo;Here is the murderer of your father, you
must be answerable for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was subsequently
conveyed to Pontefract Castle, where he was basely assassinated
by a band of armed ruffians, four of whom he killed with a
battle-axe before he fell.</p>
<p>The untimely death of Richard caused an immediate change in
the government of Oswestry.&nbsp; Its newly-created lord, the
Earl of Wiltshire, fell a victim to popular fury, and Thomas, son
of the attainted Earl of Arundel, was restored to the manorial
rights and dignities of Oswestry.&nbsp; The Earl of Huntington,
the king&rsquo;s brother, fled into the county of Essex; but
passing through a village belonging to the Countess of Hereford
(sister of the deceased Richard, Earl of Arundel), he was
discovered, and arrested.&nbsp; The countess apprized the new
monarch, Henry, of the capture, and desired him to send to her
the young Earl of Arundel, her nephew, that he might witness the
mode in which she intended to avenge herself of her
brother&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The Earl of Arundel posted to the
place where Huntington was prisoner, and loaded him with
reproaches.&nbsp; The countess delivered the captive nobleman,
bound with chains, into the hands of eight thousand of her
vassals, whom she called together for the occasion.&nbsp; The
wretched prisoner, struck with terror at the preparations made to
take away his life, sued for mercy, and protested that he had not
committed the foul act of which he <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>was accused.&nbsp; Had the countess
restrained her rage, and listened to reason and justice, she
would have found that Huntington was not a guilty murderer, but
that Richard, Earl of Arundel, was brought to the block mainly by
the treachery of the Earl of Nottingham.&nbsp; Heedless of his
protestations and cries for mercy, she commanded her vassals to
cut him to pieces.&nbsp; His assembled executioners are said to
have taken pity upon him; whilst the countess and young earl
strenuously urged his death.&nbsp; Maddened by rage, she
exclaimed, &ldquo;Curse on ye all, villains; you have not the
courage to put a man to death.&rdquo;&nbsp; This violent
exclamation roused an esquire, who offered himself as
executioner.&nbsp; He seized the hatchet, and approached
Huntington, but was so touched with his tender complaints, that
he trembled with emotion; and returning to the countess, his eyes
being filled with tears, he said, &ldquo;I would not put the earl
to death for all the gold in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
countess, full of indignation, looking at him &ldquo;unutterable
things,&rdquo; exclaimed, &ldquo;Do what thou hast promised, or
thy own head shall be cut off.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he heard this he
was so afraid that he knew not what to do, and approaching the
earl again said, &ldquo;Sir, I entreat your pardon; forgive me
your death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then struck him a violent blow on the
shoulder, which felled him to the ground.&nbsp; Huntington sprang
up again, and said, &ldquo;Alas, man, why do you treat me
thus?&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake kill me more
easily.&rdquo;&nbsp; The esquire then struck him eight times on
the shoulder, being so terrified that he could not aim his blows
at the neck.&nbsp; Another blow followed, which fell on the neck,
when the wretched nobleman, suffering pain and agony from his
cruel treatment, cried out, &ldquo;Alas, dear friend, have pity
upon me, and free me from my pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The executioner
then seized a knife, and cut the Earl&rsquo;s throat, separating
his head from the body.</p>
<p>The Glyndwr or Glendower insurrection arose about this period,
and the town of Oswestry greatly suffered from it.&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Owain Glyndwr
was descended on the mother&rsquo;s side from Llywelyn, the last
sovereign Prince of Wales, his father, Grufydd Vychan, having
married Helen, a grand-daughter of that puissant chieftain.&nbsp;
He studied the law at one of the Inns of Court in London, and
finally was admitted as a barrister.&nbsp; He may have quitted
his profession, for we find he was appointed an esquire to
Richard II., to whom he was devotedly attached, and whose
fortunes he followed even to Flint Castle, and till his royal
master&rsquo;s household was dissolved.&nbsp; He had been
knighted by King Richard, and was married early in life to
Margaret, daughter to Sir David Hanmer, of Hanmer, in Flintshire,
one of the Justices of the Court of the King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp;
His resentment against Henry IV. was strong and implacable.&nbsp;
He had suffered deep private wrongs from the usurpation of the
king, and burned with indignation to avenge himself.</p>
<p>Owain Glyndwr&rsquo;s sudden appearance as a military leader
of his countrymen roused their ancient martial spirit, and
thousands flocked to his standard.&nbsp; In the year 1400 the
town of Oswestry was burned, the Welsh having attacked it; and in
1403 Owain Glyndwr assembled his forces in the town, that he
might join Lord Percy (surnamed Henry Hotspur) against the
king.&nbsp; The Welsh leader dispatched to the &ldquo;tented
field&rdquo; his first division only, amounting to 4000 men,
whose prowess was distinguished on the day of battle.&nbsp; The
great body of his troops, about 12,000 in number, did not
approach nearer than Oswestry, they having been detained at the
siege of Kidweli Castle.&nbsp; It is thought by some writers,
that Owain did not remain inactively at Oswestry.&nbsp; Gough,
the historian, mentions, that about two miles from Shrewsbury,
where the Pool road diverges from that leading to Oswestry,
&ldquo;there stands an ancient decayed Oak Tree, of which there
is a tradition, that Glyndwr ascended it to reconnoitre; but
finding that the king was in great force, and that the Earl of
Northumberland had not joined his son, he fell <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>back to
Oswestry, and immediately afterwards retreated into
Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;<i>Beauties of England and Wales</i>,&rdquo; the
Shropshire history edited by Mr. Rylance, we find the following
passage on Glyndwr&rsquo;s alledged abandonment of Hotspur
&ldquo;at his utmost need:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The army of Glyndwr, amounting to twelve
thousand men, had remained inactive at Oswestry during the
battle.&nbsp; There is a tradition that he himself quitted that
place in disguise, and hastening to Shrewsbury, hid himself in a
gigantic oak, which commanded a full view of the field; and that
after witnessing the discomfiture of his friends, returning with
speed to Oswestry, he withdrew his forces into Wales, whither he
was pursued by Prince Henry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hulbert, too, in his &ldquo;<i>History of the Town and County
of Salop</i>,&rdquo; referring to the famous battle, says,
&ldquo;Owain Glyndwr <i>beheld</i> the battle of Shrewsbury,
instead of <i>sustaining</i>, by his arms, the cause of his ally,
the gallant and intrepid Hotspur.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another writer on
this memorable event declares, that had Glyndwr brought up his
reserved troops when Hotspur by his impetuous onslaughts was
within an ace of victory, or when the brave warrior was slain,
the battle would have been won, and the royal forces entirely
routed.&nbsp; Taking these allegements to be truths, Glyndwr
perpetrated a baseness which all faithful men must condemn.</p>
<p>Many writers have taken pains to solve the question,
&ldquo;Did Owain Glyndwr act merely as an idle spectator at the
battle of Shrewsbury; or did he actually lead his <i>corps de
reserve</i> to Shelton, to aid the gallant Hotspur?&rdquo;&nbsp;
No author that we have read has settled that doubtful
inquiry.&nbsp; Owain&rsquo;s hatred of Henry, and his ardent
efforts to give freedom to his countrymen, with his chivalrous
bearing in the rebellion he had created, would suggest no
evidence that Glyndwr was pusillanimous; and yet history
furnishes alleged facts strongly reflecting upon his heroic
spirit, and almost charging him <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>with craven cowardice.&nbsp; To
conclude that Glyndwr was actuated by base and unmanly curiosity
in perching himself upon a branch of the Shelton Oak would be to
brand his name with infamy; and yet, if he were espying the
battle from that famous tree, his troops being close in reserve,
but not in action, an accusation no less severe must ever rest
upon his character as a chieftain and a man.&nbsp; On this
interesting subject, which will always engage the attention of
historical readers, a poet of bright fancy and manly
sentiment&mdash;Dovaston of Westfelton&mdash;has given sarcastic
expression to an opinion, in a Miltonic sonnet on the Shelton
Oak, that Owain Glyndwr, at the battle of Shrewsbury, was a
traitor to gallantry and faith:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tradition says, and why not trust
Tradition,<br />
When many a haunt breathes, hallowed by her song,<br />
From this Great Oak, backed by twelve thousand men,<br />
Wrung at their country&rsquo;s wrongs and murdered king,<br />
Glyndwr, the wise, the bountiful, the brave,<br />
<i>Beheld young Percy fall</i>: and conquest crown<br />

<p>&ldquo;The Battle of Shrewsbury&rdquo; is not only
&ldquo;clad,&rdquo; as the same poet fancifully describes,
&ldquo;in cold-hearted History&rsquo;s homely weeds,&rdquo; but
&ldquo;garlanded with Avon&rsquo;s dewy flowers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
conflict is part of the history of this district; and the
narrative we subjoin, from the able pens of the historians of
Shrewsbury, will attract the attention of all who value
&ldquo;pure English, undefiled:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of the famous and severely-contested battle
which ensued under the walls of our town, the awful prelude to so
many more between the rival houses, through the remainder of the
century, we have five contemporary and perhaps independent
narratives; but one of them is a mass of errors, and another <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>extremely
succinct, and of the others only one is circumstantial: nor is
any of them sufficient to satisfy the minute curiosity of the
local historian: but the best account that can be drawn from a
comparison of the whole, supplied in some instances by a
consideration of the ground, and in a few others by modest
conjecture, shall be laid before the reader as the conclusion of
the present chapter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are unable to trace the progress of Hotspur&rsquo;s
long march from the North to Shrewsbury, a journey of not less
than 250 miles.&nbsp; He probably set out in the beginning of
July; and skirting along the eastern side of Cheshire, where his
army received a considerable augmentation, passed through
Stafford, and was joined there by his uncle the earl of
Worcester.&nbsp; The king, aware of his intention to gain
possession of Shrewsbury, and desirous of cutting off his
junction with Glendower, pursued him with hasty marches.&nbsp; We
find his majesty on the 16th of July at Burton-upon-Trent, and on
the 17th at Lichfield: whence, finding that he could not overtake
his enemy, he hastened on to reach Shrewsbury before him.&nbsp;
He would naturally take the Watling Street road, and enter this
town over the Abbey Bridge.&nbsp; The route of Hotspur was more
to the north, in order to keep up a communication with the
Severn, so important for his junction with Glendower.&nbsp; In
all probability he marched through Newport, by High Ercall and
Haghmond Hill; and hoped to gain admittance through the North or
Castle Gate.&nbsp; The king arrived just in time to save the
town: he entered it only a few hours before Hotspur, who reached
the Castle Foregate on the evening of Friday, July 19th, and the
king&rsquo;s forces could not have advanced from Lichfield before
the morning of that day.&nbsp; They were certainly here before
Percy: for, aware of the intention of that young nobleman, and
desirous to save the Castle from his attack, they set fire to
that extensive suburb, and marched out of the Castle gates to
offer him battle.&nbsp; Hotspur, unwilling to bring his army <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>into action
at the close of a toilsome march, and learning, from the royal
banner which waved on the walls, that the king was in possession
of the town, called off his followers from the attack, and
retired to the Bull-field, an extensive common which stretched
from Upper Berwick to the East.&nbsp; He thus protected his rear
by the woody and impervious precipices extending to Leaton shelf,
and had the river not only on his side, but also, if it had not
entirely deserted its ancient channel under Cross-hill, (as there
is reason to believe it had not,) in his front also.&nbsp; This
position enabled him likewise to communicate readily over that
stream by the ford of Shelton with the forces of Glendower, when
they should arrive, as he hoped, on the opposite bank.&nbsp; Here
he passed the night in council.&nbsp; His army consisted of
14,000 chosen men, of whom a considerable part were of the county
of Chester, at that time eminent for its skill in archery; but,
if Hall is correct, the royal army was nearly double that number;
for he writes that above 40,000 men were assembled on both parts,
and every circumstance of the battle proves that the king was at
the head of a very superior force.&nbsp; His situation was,
however, by no means devoid of anxiety.&nbsp; He must have been
conscious how slender the title was which he possessed to the
throne: and how ill-disposed his peerage of the realm were to
maintain him upon it.&nbsp; From the Castle he might view, as the
dawn arose, the plain which stretched to the north glittering
with hostile arms: while the dreadful Glendower was believed to
be in full march from Oswestry, to join the rebels with his Welsh
forces.&nbsp; But the difficulties of the crisis only sufficed to
call forth his energies and display his talents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry was himself a distinguished warrior.&nbsp; In
earlier life he had, in company with his princely uncle the duke
of Gloucester, travelled into the north of Europe in quest of
martial glory; and under the banners of the renowned Teutonic
order had made a glorious campaign against the Pagans of
Lithuania.&nbsp; He was still in the vigour of life, being much
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>under
forty years of age, and an adversary every way worthy of the
gallant Percy; whom, relying upon the superiority of his numbers,
he determined, if possible, to force to an engagement, before
that nobleman should receive his reinforcements from Wales or the
north.&nbsp; By break of day, therefore, he dispatched, it is
probable, a strong force, under the nominal command, for it could
be no more, of the young prince, the future hero of Agincourt,
but then a youth of fourteen years, to come up with Hotspur at
Berwick, if possible.&nbsp; He himself, with the main body,
appears to have marched out on the Hadnall road, ready to proceed
as occasion might demand, either to the north of Cross Hill and
Almond Pool, and close the rebels between his two divisions; or
else to advance further on upon that road, where it branches off
to Shawbury, with the view of cutting off their retreat, if
Hotspur, aware of his design, should attempt to march to the
east.&nbsp; It happened as the king anticipated.&nbsp; Hotspur,
on his advance, broke up in some disorder, and marched by
Harlescot and Abright Hussey to Hately-field, which stretches
from thence eastwards.&nbsp; Here, however, finding it impossible
to avoid an engagement, on account, as we may suppose, of the
obstruction to his retreat presented by the king&rsquo;s movement
above mentioned, he made his stand in the rear of a field of peas
nearly ripe; behind which he stationed his army, and hoped
thereby to deter the king from advancing over a tract which must
necessarily impede his operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then addressed his little army in a short harangue,
of which Walsingham has preserved the heads. &lsquo;We must
desist,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;from any further attempt to
retreat, and turn our arms on those that come against us.&nbsp;
Ye see the royal banner, nor is there time to seek a passage even
though we wished it.&nbsp; Stand, therefore, with steadfast
hearts: for this day shall either promote us all, if we conquer;
or deliver us from an usurper, if we fall: and it is better to
die in battle for the common wealth, than after battle by the
sentence of <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>our foe:&rdquo; and with this, to support the courage of
his men by proving his design to fight to the outrance, he
dispatched two of his esquires, Knayton and Salvayn, with that
strange defiance, in which he loads the king with the most horrid
crimes. * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has informed us how the king received this
furious manifesto.&nbsp; He had something else to engage his
attention.&nbsp; He proceeded to marshal his forces, dividing
them into two columns, or wedges.&nbsp; Of one of these he took
the command himself, and entrusted the other to his son.&nbsp;
The front rank of his own column was led on by his nephew the
young earl of Stafford, a soldier of conspicuous valour, on whom
he had that morning conferred the high office of constable of
England, recently enjoyed by the earl of Northumberland.&nbsp;
Previous to the final onset, the king, in compliance with the
customs of chivalry, bestowed the honour of knighthood on certain
of his most distinguished esquires.&nbsp; Hotspur, perceiving
that an engagement was unavoidable, called for his favourite
sword.&nbsp; His attendants informed him that it was left behind
at Berwick, of which village it does not appear that he had till
then learned the name.&nbsp; At these words he turned pale, and
said, &lsquo;I perceive that my plough is drawing to its last
furrow, for a wizard told me in Northumberland that I should
perish at Berwick: which I vainly interpreted of that town in the
North.&rsquo;&nbsp; His courage did not, however, yield to the
impressions of superstition; he rallied his spirits, and arranged
his troops with his usual ability: assigning their respective
stations to his uncle Worcester, the Scottish earl of Douglas,
his recent captive at Halidown, sir Richard Venables, baron of
Kinderton, Hugh Brow, Hugh Vernon, and others.&nbsp; His troops
appear to have been chiefly stationed on the north side of the
spot now occupied by the church in a field still called <i>the
Hateleys</i>: on the east side of the church is a field
denominated <i>the King&rsquo;s croft</i>, in which, it may be
presumed, were ranged those which the king commanded in
person.&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>These positions exactly agree with the objects which we
have assigned above to the respective leaders; and lend, it is
hoped, some confirmation to the conjectural part of the preceding
narration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the hostile armies, drawn up in battle array
facing each other, waited, with mute expectation, the sound of
the trumpet, the dreadful signal for combat, two venerable
divines, Thomas Prestbury, lord abbot of Salop, and the clerk of
the privy seal, advanced out of the royal army, and proceeded
towards that of Percy.&nbsp; The king, desirous to spare the
blood of his subjects, offered him and his adherents pardon and
peace, and redress of all grievances of which they could justly
complain.&nbsp; Hotspur was touched by these unexpected
overtures, made under circumstances of such numerical inequality,
and requested his uncle of Worcester to repair to the royal
presence in company of these holy men, and state the grounds on
which he had taken up arms.&nbsp; The king, we may suppose, was
in his turn somewhat softened by the sight of the earl, who had
been so recently engaged in the domestic office of governor to
the prince of Wales; and a recollection of the obligations he had
received from the Percy family might mix itself with his other
reflections.&nbsp; It is certain that to the remonstrances of
Worcester, delivered in a fierce and haughty tone, he listened
with respect, and replied with a condescension which, in the
opinion of the spectators, was somewhat unbefitting the royal
dignity.&nbsp; A contemporary writer has preserved, though with a
mistake of the person, the dialogue supposed to have passed
between them.&nbsp; The king &lsquo;counselled him to put himself
on his grace.&rsquo;&nbsp; To which the other replied, &lsquo;I
trust not in your grace.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I pray God,&rsquo;
rejoined the king, &lsquo;that thou mayest have to answer for the
blood here to be shed this day, and not I.&nbsp; March on
standard-bearer!&rsquo; and the battle was set.&mdash;It is
certain that the stern temper of Worcester rejected all attempts
at conciliation: he was conscious how deeply he had been engaged
in fomenting <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>the quarrel; and, on his return to his friends, he
misrepresented the demeanour of Henry in such a manner to his
nephew, that the latter, with whatever reluctance, was compelled
to relinquish all hopes of accommodation.&nbsp; At length,
therefore, much of the day having been consumed in these
fruitless negociations, both parties flew to arms, and the air
was rent with the war-cries of &lsquo;<i>St. George</i>&rsquo; on
one side, and &lsquo;<i>Esperance Percy</i>&rsquo; on the
other.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, Glendower had advanced as far as
Shelton on the opposite bank of Severn, where he awaited the
issue of the contest, determined to proceed or retire according
to its event.&nbsp; He is said, by the constant tradition of the
country, to have ascended there the branches of a lofty oak,
whose venerable trunk yet remains, for the purpose of viewing the
battle; at least of gaining, from personal inspection, the
earliest intelligence of its event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fight began by furious and repeated volleys of
arrows from Hotspur&rsquo;s archers, whose ground, as may be
seen, greatly favoured that kind of warfare: and they did great
execution on the royal army.&nbsp; The king&rsquo;s bowmen were
not wanting in return, and the battle raged with violence.&nbsp;
The military art had not yet attained that perfection which
almost supersedes the effect of individual exertion; and Hotspur,
with his associate Douglas, bent on the king&rsquo;s destruction,
rushing through the midst of the hostile arrows, pierced their
way to the spot on which he stood.&nbsp; To adopt the vivid
language of a contemporary, &lsquo;in the ardour of his spirit,
he assembled a band of thirty warriors, broke into the royal
army, and made a great alley in the midst thereof,&rsquo; (such
was the terror which his presence inspired) &lsquo;even to the
stoutest of the king&rsquo;s guards.&rsquo;&nbsp; Monstrelet
says, Henry was thrice unhorsed by the Scottish earl, and would
have been taken or slain had he not been defended and rescued by
his own men.&nbsp; And the fortune of the day would have been
forthwith decided, if the Scottish earl of March had not
withdrawn him <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>from the danger; for the royal standard-bearer was
slain, his banner beaten down; and many of the chosen band
appointed to guard it (among whom were the earl of Stafford and
sir Walter Blount,) were killed by these desperate
assailants,&mdash;while the young prince of Wales was wounded in
the face by an arrow.&nbsp; In short, notwithstanding all the
exertions of the royalists, victory seemed inclined to favour the
rebel army, who fought with renewed ardour, from an opinion
naturally derived from the overthrow of his standard, that the
king himself had fallen, and animated each other to the combat
with cheering and redoubled shouts of &lsquo;<i>Henry Percy</i>,
<i>king</i>!&nbsp; <i>Henry Percy</i>, <i>king</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this critical moment the gallant Percy, raging
through the adverse ranks in quest of his sovereign, fell by an
unknown hand; alone, and hemmed in by foes.&nbsp; The king lost
no time to avail himself of this event.&nbsp; Straining his voice
to the utmost, he exclaimed aloud, &lsquo;<i>Henry Percy is
dead</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; The sound was heard by either army: into
those it struck dismay, while these it animated and
encouraged.&nbsp; The rebels fled in every direction, nor could
the king, anxious as he was to terminate the slaughter, restrain
the impetuous pursuit of his own troops, till the flower of
Cheshire, two hundred knights and esquires (besides pages and
footmen) were slain.&nbsp; Douglas broke through, and endeavoured
to escape in the direction of Haghmond-hill: being closely
pursued, and leaping from a crag, he experienced a severe injury,
and was captured: but the king, in admiration of his valour, set
him at liberty.&nbsp; The loss in both armies was great. * * * An
ancient manuscript rates the number of gentlemen at two thousand
two hundred and ninety-one, besides commons.&nbsp; They were
chiefly buried, says that authority, in a great pit, the
dimensions of which are there specified, and over which the
present church of Battlefield was afterwards erected: but many
are stated to have lain dispersed in various directions for the
space of three miles about the field of <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>battle: a
fact which confirms what has been said above of the desultory
nature of the conflict.&nbsp; Others, of the most distinguished
rank, were interred in the neighbouring town, chiefly in the
cemetery of the Dominican or St. Mary&rsquo;s Friars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body of Hotspur was at first delivered to his
kinsman lord Furnival for interment, and it was by him committed
to the ground with the suffrages of the church, and with all the
honours which, in that haste, could be procured as due to his
rank.&nbsp; It is painful to reflect, that the king afterwards
repented him of this generous attention to the remains of
deceased valour.&nbsp; He caused the corpse to be taken out of
the tomb in which it had been laid, and to be placed between two
mill-stones in the public street, near the pillory; where, as if
he feared lest the general sympathy should rescue it from its
ignominious situation, it was kept under military guard, till the
head was severed from the body, which was divided into quarters,
and transmitted to several cities in the realm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus closes this circumstantial and able description of the
celebrated battle of Shrewsbury; an event so interesting in the
annals of the county, that we make no apology for having
transferred so detailed an account of it to our pages.&nbsp; A
nobler theme could not well be conceived for the lay of a
minstrel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The characters of the leaders, both of the
royal and of the rebel party, the chivalrous spirit of the times
in which they lived, and the magnitude of the cause that roused
them to arms, are circumstances highly susceptible of poetical
description, while the train of incidents from the very origin to
the termination of the feud, is of that romantic cast which
requires little embellishment from fiction.&nbsp; There is indeed
one objection which may have deterred our later Poets from the
undertaking; it is, that the ground which Shakspeare has trod is
sacred; but without any violation of the reverence due to his
memory, it may be wished that this magnificent subject had also
been celebrated by the muse that sang the tale of Flodden
Field.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>We have
already stated that on the deposition of Richard II. the Earl of
Wiltshire, recently appointed lord of the Manor of Oswestry, fell
a victim to popular fury, and Thomas, son of Richard, Earl of
Arundel, was restored in blood.&nbsp; This last-named nobleman
was a liberal supporter of the Corporation of Oswestry.&nbsp; In
1406 he gave it a release for &pound;100 (a large sum in those
days,) which that body was indebted to him, in consideration of
the distresses which the town had suffered during the Glyndwr
insurrection.&nbsp; He also obtained pardon from the king for his
vassals in Chirk, Bromfield, and the Manor of Oswestry, for the
share they had taken in that rebellion.&nbsp; In the same year
with the release he granted a most extensive Charter to the town,
containing many matters showing the customs of the times.&nbsp;
This Charter ordered, that &ldquo;neither the lord nor his heirs
should confiscate or seize the effects of persons with or without
will in the corporation; that no burgess should be compelled to
be the lord&rsquo;s receiver-general, but only collector of the
issues arising within the borough; that the burgesses should be
discharged from all fees demanded by the Constable of the castle,
or any of his menial servants, for any felonies or trespasses
committed out of the same liberties, when brought to the prison
of the castle; saving that the Constable might receive one penny
at his own election, from every mansion-house in the town, and a
farthing from every cottage, on the feast of St. Stephen
annually; that the burgesses should be free for the future from
all excise of ale, brewed and sold in the town, which had
hitherto been payable at the rate of seven-pence for every
<i>Bracena cervisi&aelig;</i> exposed for sale; that they were to
be freed from the duty of <i>Amobyr</i>, or <i>Lyre-Wyte</i>;
that whoever lived in the house of a burgess, and happened to die
there, the burgess was to have a heriot after his decease, in the
same manner as the <i>Uchelwyr</i>, or freeholders residing on
the lands of the lord in the Hundred of Oswestry; that no
Shrewsbury ale should be sold in the town without license, while
any ale brewed in the <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>town was to be had, under the penalty
of 6s. 8d.; that none of the inhabitants of the lordships of
Oswestry, Melverley, Kinardsley, Edgerley, Ruyton, and the eleven
towns, should drive or carry any cattle, corn, or victuals, or
other wares, to any foreign fair or market, before the same had
first been exposed for sale in the town of Oswestry, under the
penalty of 6s. 8d.; that none of the lord&rsquo;s tenants should
be compelled to pay the <i>redditus advocarii</i> for the
security of the castle,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The <i>Amobyr</i> of
the Welsh, and the <i>Lyre-Wyte</i> of the Saxons, were fines
paid by the vassal to his lord, to buy off the power to violate
domestic relations.&nbsp; Pennant gives a different
interpretation to the term <i>Amobyr</i>, but does not succeed in
giving us its literal and precise meaning.&nbsp; There is one
curious fact mentioned in the aforesaid Charter, and which, even
in these days must excite a smile.&nbsp; The respective
<i>six-and-eightpences</i> of the gentlemen who now study
&ldquo;Coke upon Littleton&rdquo; was actually prescribed even so
far back as the fifteenth century.&nbsp; It would be a still more
curious fact developed, were we acquainted with the lord of the
Manor&rsquo;s law-adviser when this Charter was granted, because
we might perhaps then be able, from the knowledge of that fact,
to ascribe the origin, if not honour, of lawyers&rsquo;
<i>six-and-eightpences</i> to the ancient Borough of
Oswestry!</p>
<p>According to Pennant, &ldquo;until the time of the
above-mentioned Charter, the lord&rsquo;s Welsh tenants of the
Hundred of Oswestry were accustomed by their tenure to keep watch
and ward, for three days and three nights, at the four gates of
the town, during the fairs of St. Andrew and St. Oswald, with a
certain number of men called <i>Kaies</i>; but these
treacherously, with others, ravaged and plundered the
place.&nbsp; On this the tenants were compelled to pay a sum of
money as wages to a sufficient number of Englishmen, as the
burgesses should think convenient, for the custody of the four
gates; and the Welsh men were for ever to be discharged from that
duty.&nbsp; The vassals of the Earl of Arundel in these <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>parts were of
a mixed nature; either descendants of the Norman followers of
Alan, or of the native Welsh, who were most numerous, and bore an
hereditary dislike to their co-tenants of foreign stock.&nbsp;
The Welsh part was called <i>Walcheria</i>, and lay in the upper
part of the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverting to Owain Glyndwr&rsquo;s career, we see that his
escape from the Shelton Oak, at the Battle of Shrewsbury, did not
deter him from fresh enterprises.&nbsp; Evidently regardless of
the ruin of his allies&mdash;they, as Leland tells us,
&ldquo;whom he promised to unite with&rdquo; at that
battle&mdash;he continued to infest the English borders, where he
committed great havoc, the king being unable, from the want of
funds, to resist his aggressions.&nbsp; Owain&rsquo;s marauding
parties committed serious damage to Shrewsbury and several of the
adjoining townships, and extended their ravages as far as
Buildwas Abbey, which they wasted with fire, so that divine
service was for a time discontinued, and the monks were reduced
to the greatest poverty.&nbsp; At length Henry directed a writ to
Edward Charlton, Lord Powys, to raise forces with which to subdue
the renewed rebellion; and similar orders were sent to Lords
Arundel and Grey, and Sir Richard L&rsquo;Strange, Lord of
Knockin, Ellesmere, and other bordering manors.&nbsp; Glyndwr had
despatched to Shrewsbury two of his best officers, Rhys Ddu and
Philipot Scudamore, to command the insurrectionary party; but
Lord Powys, having promptly obeyed the orders of his sovereign,
fortified several castles, and speedily took as prisoners the
above-named two leaders, and they were both soon afterwards
executed in London.&nbsp; Holinshed says, that &ldquo;Glyndwr
himself in the same year, dreading to show his face to any
creature, and finally lacking meat to sustain nature, for mere
hunger and lack of food miserably pined away and
died.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was living, however, six years later, but
in a state of concealment, chiefly at the house of one of his
daughters, married to a gentleman of Herefordshire named
Monnington.&nbsp; In July, 1415, the new king Henry V., <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>anxious to
leave his country in tranquillity before he engaged in the war
with France, offered a pardon to Glyndwr; and this would probably
have been accepted by the Cambrian chieftain, had not the
negotiation been interrupted by his death, which occurred
September 30th, 1415, in the 61st year of his age.&nbsp; It is
said that David Holbetch, Steward of the manors of Oswestry,
Bromfield, and Yale, and founder of the Oswestry Free Grammar
School, took a distinguished part in this negotiation, and
obtained the promised pardon for Glyndwr.&nbsp; Tradition states
that he was buried in the churchyard of Monnington-on-Wye.</p>
<p>With Glyndwr ceased most of the troubles and calamities which
had too long afflicted the English and Welsh Borders.&nbsp; The
superstitious charm with which Owain&rsquo;s name had been
invested by his countrymen soon faded away, and his life, though
startling in a rude and ignorant age, soon proved that he was
&ldquo;in the common roll of men!&rdquo;&nbsp; Shakspere was
justified in creating him, poetically, as self-idolatrous, for
his daring incursions and fiery movements indicate that he
believed himself to be of the meteoric class, to curb oppression
and give liberty to the enslaved.&nbsp; For years after
Glyndwr&rsquo;s fall Oswestry, for aught that history tells us to
the contrary, lay in comparative repose, entirely free from
foreign aggression.&nbsp; Intestine feuds and disorders seem to
have been the chief disturbers.&nbsp; The Welsh were arrayed
against the English, and the latter appear to have had no less
enmity against their Cambrian neighbours.&nbsp; To
Pennant&rsquo;s industrious and accurate research we are indebted
for the scanty notices collected of the history of this
period.&nbsp; Among the records of the Drapers&rsquo; Company of
Shrewsbury, he tells us there is the following
order:&mdash;&ldquo;25 Eliz. 1513.&nbsp; Ordered, that no Draper
set out for Oswestry on Mondays before six o&rsquo;clock, on
forfeiture of six shillings and eightpence; and that they wear
their weapons all the way, and go in company&mdash;not to go over
the Welsh Bridge before the bell toll six.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>However
numerous and fierce marauders were in the days here referred to,
it would seem that peaceful employments were nevertheless pursued
by the inhabitants of Oswestry, and that their manufactured cloth
was of so good a quality as to be held in high repute among the
Shrewsbury Drapers.&nbsp; The &ldquo;contests, robberies, and
disturbances in the Marches of Wales&rdquo; still continuing with
unabated force, and both Welsh and English seeming to have
considered everything as lawful plunder which they could seize in
each other&rsquo;s territory, the Stewards, the Constable, and
Lieutenant of Oswestry and Powys entered into covenants in the
year 1534, to restrain these plundering excursions.&nbsp; It was
agreed, that &ldquo;if, after a certain day then fixed, any
person of one lordship committed felony in the other, he should
be taken and sent into the lordship where the offence was
committed, to receive punishment; and that if any goods or cattle
were stolen from one lordship and conveyed into the other, the
tenants and inhabitants of that lordship should either pay for
the same within fifteen days, or otherwise four principal men
should remain in bail, a main-prize, till they were either paid
for or recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these rigorous measures, the evil still
continued; and so alarmed were certain of the inhabitants of
Shrewsbury, and regardful of the safety of their fellow-burgesses
who had to visit Oswestry market weekly, that prayers for their
preservation were offered up in one of the churches, on Monday
mornings, before they started on their perilous journey.&nbsp; A
timid gentleman, William Jones, Esq., left to the Drapers&rsquo;
Company &ldquo;one pound six-shillings and eight-pence, to be
paid annually to the Vicar of St. Alkmond&rsquo;s Church, for
reading prayers on Monday mornings, before the Drapers set out
for Oswestry market!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pennant informs us that at this
period &ldquo;Oswestry was the great emporium for Welsh cloth; a
privilege to which it was well entitled from its vicinity to
those districts of Wales in which that important branch of
commerce was manufactured, at a period <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>when the English trader could not,
with any degree of safety, trust himself in the
Principality.&nbsp; To this town (Oswestry) the Drapers of
Shrewsbury repaired every Monday.&nbsp; We learn the fact from a
curious MS. Chronicle of the last-mentioned town, which relates
that &lsquo;on Monday, Dec. 5th, 1575, the Drapers of Shrewsbury
had like to have been robbed, if they had not been privately
warned; but the bailiffs and a great company went, strongly
aimed, upon their usual trade toward Oswestry.&nbsp; The robbers
proposed to rob them in the dale between Shelton and Shrewsbury,
and lay over night in Master Sherar&rsquo;s barn, on the other
side of the water.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole narrative, which is
told much at length in the Chronicle, exhibits the unsettled
police of a country slowly emerging from a state of barbarism,
and strongly reminds the reader of the inimitable scene at
Gadshill, so admirably pourtrayed by our great dramatic bard in
the first part of Henry IV.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same writer adds,
&ldquo;notwithstanding, however, this and similar proofs of the
general insecurity of the country, the Welsh manufacturer was
unwilling to meet the purchaser even half way with his
commodities.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not satisfied,&rsquo; says our
countryman Dr. Peter Heylyn, in his <i>Cosmography</i>,
&lsquo;with having fixed the market at Oswestry, they sought to
draw the staple more into their own country.&rsquo;&nbsp; The MS.
quoted above informs us, under the year 1582, that it would have
been removed thence, &lsquo;to the great decay of that town and
of Shrewsbury, yf Sir Thomas Bromley, being Lord Chancelor, had
not by his great wisdom opened the same to the Queen&rsquo;s
Majestie, for which godly deede theye of the said townes are
contynewally bownde to praye daylye.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord Chancellor
Bromley was a Shropshire man, and possessor, by purchase from the
Earl of Arundel, of the Castle and Lordship of Shrawardine; he
was therefore personally interested in the prosperity of the
county, and by his influence at Court enabled to promote
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would further appear, that the market was
continued at Oswestry, so that it is likely that Lord
Bromley&rsquo;s interposition at Court prevailed.&nbsp; In 1585
the Welsh <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>cloth market was removed from Oswestry to Knockin, the
plague having broken out in this borough, and destroyed
&ldquo;three-score and four persons, and no more;&rdquo;
according to the parish register.&nbsp; The plague continued from
April to August, when it entirely disappeared, and the market was
held, as before, in Oswestry.</p>
<p>Oswestry was visited with other calamities some few years
before this period.&nbsp; In 1542 a fire broke out in the town,
which was so destructive, that &ldquo;two long streets with great
riches&rdquo; were consumed; and in 1567 there was another fire,
which destroyed &ldquo;seven-score within the walls, and
three-score without.&rdquo;&nbsp; The suburb still known by the
name of <i>Pentre-Poeth</i> (the burnt end of the town) suffered
severely, and may have derived its designation from this
destructive fire; or, as Price intimates, from the frequent fires
that may have occurred there during the conflicts between the
Welsh and English.&nbsp; These accidents were looked upon, at the
time, through astrological telescopes, by Camden, the historian,
and a Dr. Childrey.&nbsp; They both gravely ascribed these events
to astrological phenomena, Camden seriously remarking,
&ldquo;that the eclipses of the sun in Aries have been very fatal
to this place; for in the years 1542 and 1567, when the sun was
eclipsed in that sign, it (Oswestry) suffered much by
fire!&rdquo;&nbsp; After reading such absurdity as this from men
professing to be learned, we have reason to be thankful that we
are living in a more enlightened and scientific age.</p>
<p>A few years before the conflagration last referred to, the
town was visited by a no less alarming evil.&nbsp; In 1559
pestilence consigned to the grave, within one year, more than
five hundred of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The disease which thus
afflicted the people is stated to have commenced with profuse
perspiration, (from which it was called &ldquo;the sweating
sickness,&rdquo;) and to have continued until the death or
recovery of the patient.&nbsp; Its operation was quick and
powerful, and cure or death occurred within twenty-four
hours.&nbsp; Those persons who were seized in <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>the day were
put to bed in their clothes to wait the issue; and those seized
in the night were desired to remain in bed, but not to
sleep.&nbsp; The desolation of the town during the long
continuance of the plague is described in affecting language by
the writer of the clever historical sketches, on the History of
Oswestry, that appear in Mr. Roberts&rsquo;s publication,
entitled &ldquo;Oswald&rsquo;s Well:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was then that Croeswylan received its
name.&nbsp; <i>Croes wylan</i>, or the Cross of weeping, was
there erected, the base of which still remains to be seen.&nbsp;
To this, with superstitious reverence, all the people
resorted.&nbsp; The diseased and dying sought in grief beneath
its sacred shadow a preparation for the doom to which they were
appointed, and there they languished till that doom was
fixed.&nbsp; Before it, the whole and healthy ones confessed and
deplored their sins, and deprecated the vengeance of
heaven.&nbsp; Throughout the succeeding century this foul
contagion lurked on our shores, and at intervals visited our
town, converting it into a vast charnel house.&nbsp; Its attacks
were so insidious and sudden that the glow of health suffered no
process of removal, but instantly fled, as scared and affrighted
on the approach of the fell devourer.&nbsp; During its presence
no sights were to be seen but the wan and sickly visage of those
who were dying, or the panic-stricken gaze of the man yet
uninfected, almost delirious with alarm, and starting from the
touch of the dearest friend of his heart.&nbsp; The air was rent
with shrieks and laden with lamentation.&nbsp; Death alone seemed
contented and satisfied, and sat like a monster unmoved as he
banqueted on hundreds of his victims.&nbsp; All commerce was at a
stand-still.&nbsp; Every house was locked, the inmates scarcely
venturing upon a communication with each other, much less
exposing themselves to contact with those without.&nbsp; With
foreboding reluctance they breathed the breath of heaven,
pregnant as it was with the seeds of death.&nbsp; If one of their
number was attacked, no consideration of friendship or kindred
spared him the aggravation of being hurled into the street, there
to await the regular arrival of the dead-cart.&nbsp; That sad
accompaniment <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>of the contagion, the gibbet of the scene, rolled
sullenly along the death-smitten streets upon its gloomy mission,
and never returned without the sad evidences of the rapid
progress of the desolating scourge.&nbsp; In the ears of the
expiring it must have sounded like the toll of the passing bell,
the knell of their speedy departure.&nbsp; Upon it, whether dead
or just gasping for life, the diseased victims were heaped, and
hurried off to the brink of a huge pit, dug, probably, in a
corner of the Old Churchyard, into which they were remorselessly
thrown.&nbsp; Everything bespoke the presence and working of a
mighty power, in league with &lsquo;the King of
terrors.&rsquo;&nbsp; All human ties were forcibly disrupted,
every human sympathy was sacrilegiously immolated, until the
people were reduced to that extremity of sadness, in which life
is burdensome for its sorrows, and death terrible for the grim
and ghastly shroud in which it lies hid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The market was held, during the Plague, at <i>Croes wylan</i>,
that the people from the surrounding country-places should not
visit the town, and thereby suffer from the infection.&nbsp; No
doubt that with the dreadful scourge stalked, hand in hand, gaunt
poverty.&nbsp; It may be easily imagined that the poor suffered
severely from the sickness, and that many of them required
relief.&nbsp; We have some testimony before us that the public
authorities of the time sympathized with the sufferers.&nbsp; The
following extracts from the &ldquo;Accompt of Richard ap Lley,
Muringer of the town of Oswestr, for and from the xvj day of
September, in the 2nd yere of our sovraynge Lady
Elizabeth,&rdquo; show how pecuniary aid was rendered to certain
parties:&mdash;</p>

<p>With these awful calamities the people endured severe
privation, both as to food and clothing.&nbsp; Provisions had
risen so enormously in price as to place even the coarsest food
beyond the reach of the poor.&nbsp; We are told that so deficient
were the working-classes of the commonest provision, that they
were glad to resort, for subsistence, to horse-bread, composed of
beans, oats, and bran.&nbsp; &ldquo;The good old times&rdquo; are
too frequently quoted as periods of comfort, compared with the
present days; but such facts as have been now related must
convince every Englishman of right feeling that, however humble
his lot, he still possesses &ldquo;a goodly heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a considerable time no event occurred in Oswestry worthy
of detailed notice.&nbsp; In the 42nd of Elizabeth, Coke,
Attorney-General, acknowledges all the liberties and franchises
of Oswestry, by an order that all further proceedings on the part
of the Crown, on a writ of <i>Quo Warranto</i> against the
Bailiffs and Burgesses of Oswestry, should wholly cease.&nbsp; In
1603 a dispute took place between the Bailiffs, Burgesses,
&amp;c. and the Earl of Suffolk, then lord and owner of the town
and manor, the former body having, in numerous assembly, resolved
to maintain the rights and privileges granted to them by Richard
II., and confirmed by their &ldquo;late sovereigne of famous
memorye, queene Elizabeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; A petition setting forth
their grievances, mainly caused by the Earl of Suffolk&rsquo;s
steward, had been presented by them to the Lord President of the
Marches; to which Lord Suffolk replied as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

given him from yo<sup>r</sup> Towne, as exceptinge against the
Course w<sup>ch</sup> Mr. Lloyd, my Officer, healde with
you.&nbsp; Nowe you must knowe, that I doe, and will avowe him in
such things as he, in his discreation, shall find to bee
profitable for mee w<sup>ch</sup>, perchaunce, may bee
displeasinge to you, but herin you may further wronge
yo<sup>r</sup> selves then you are aware off; for yf you shall
deny to yeald mee thoes Rights &amp; Proffits that are due unto
me, as Lord of the Manor, you must then knowe, that I doe look

as I may not bee prejudized thereby: &amp; I knowe his

</blockquote>
<p>James I. in 1616, granted a Charter to the town, thus removing
&ldquo;divers doubts and ambiguities&rdquo; which had
&ldquo;arisen concerning the ancient liberties, francheses,
&amp;c., of the town and borough of Oswaldstre,&rdquo; and
extending their liberties and privileges, as well as confirming
them a body corporate, by the name of &ldquo;the Bayliff and
Burgesses of Oswestry, in the Countie of Salope.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>About
this period a heavy blow was struck at the commerce of the town,
by the Drapers of Shrewsbury (a reference to whose complaints and
apprehensions has already been made), &ldquo;who weary,&rdquo;
says Pennant, &ldquo;of their weekly journeys to Oswestry,
determined to transfer the market to their own town, from that in
which Queen Elizabeth had established it.&nbsp; But this attempt
proved in the first instance abortive.&nbsp; The Lordship of
Oswestry was enjoyed at this time by Thomas Howard, Earl of
Suffolk, to whom it had been granted by the late queen, in the
43rd year of her reign.&nbsp; He was in great favour with James,
in whose Court he held the office of Lord Chamberlain, and to
whom he had recently recommended himself by his vigilance and
promptitude in the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot.&nbsp;
Possessed of the highest notions of the privileges of the
peerage, and jealous of the infringement of his rights by the
traders of Salop, he issued his mandate to them by one of their
own body,&mdash;Arthur Kynaston, merchant of the staple, a
younger brother of the house of Ruyton,&mdash;to desist from such
attempts in future.&nbsp; Their answer is recorded in their own
books: it is entitled &lsquo;The copy of a letter sent by the
Company to the Earle of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain of his
Majestie&rsquo;s househoulde, ye 24th June, 1609.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Right Honerabell,&mdash;Your letter bearing date the
second of this June, by the hands of Mr. Kiniston wee have
received: wherein ytt appereth yor Lordship was informed that wee
the Societie of Drapers wentt aboute by underarte and menenesse
to withdraw your markett of Walsh clothe from your towne of
Oswester;&rsquo; and they proceed to exculpate themselves from
the charge in those phrases of submission which were in that day
the established usage of inferiors in their addresses to those
above them.&nbsp; This was their tone during the plenitude of the
Earl&rsquo;s power, which, five years after the date of this
letter, received a great increase by his appointment to the
exalted post of Lord High Treasurer of England.&nbsp; During this
time we may be sure <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&lsquo;the market for frize and cottons continued,
where, according to Heylin, it was originally fixed, at
Oswestry.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in 1618, the King&rsquo;s necessities
caused an enquiry into the management of the treasury, and
Suffolk, whose unbounded expenses in his magnificent palace at
Audley-End, had brought him into pecuniary difficulties, was
fined by the Court of Star Chamber in the vast sum of
&pound;30,000, and dismissed from all his employments.&nbsp; The
clemency of James mitigated this enormous fine, but the influence
of the Earl of Suffolk was gone; and in 1621 the Shrewsbury
Drapers made an order upon the books of their Company,
&lsquo;That they will not buy cloth at Oswestry, or elsewhere
than in Salop.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we have shewn in a preceding page, the struggles of the
Welsh, to recover the freedom they had lost, terminated with the
death of their last great leader, Owain Glyndwr.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Their wild spirit of independence, and their enthusiasm
for liberty,&rdquo; says the eloquent historian whom we have
already quoted, &ldquo;from this period gradually declined.&nbsp;
The blood of their beloved Princes was nearly extinct; and their
native bravery was subdued, or rendered ineffectual, by their
intestine divisions and by their repeated misfortunes.&nbsp; When
fierce valour and unregulated freedom are opposed to discipline,
to enlarged views, and to sound policy, the contest is very
unequal: it is not therefore surprising that the genius of
England at length obtained the ascendancy.&nbsp; It was, indeed,
an interesting spectacle, and might justly have excited
indignation and pity, to have seen an ancient and gallant nation,
falling the victims of private ambition, or sinking under the
weight of a superior power.&nbsp; But such emotions, which were
then due to that injured people, have lost at this period their
force and their poignancy.&nbsp; A new train of ideas arises;
when we see that the change is beneficial to the
vanquished&mdash;when we see a wild and precarious liberty
succeeded by a freedom which is secured by equal and fixed
laws&mdash;when we see manners hostile and barbarous, and a
spirit of rapine and cruelty, <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>softened down into the arts of peace,
and the milder arts of civilized life&mdash;when we see this
Remnant of the Ancient Britons uniting in interests, and mingling
in friendship with their conquerors, and enjoying with them the
same constitutional liberties; the purity of which, we trust,
will continue uncorrupted as long as the British Empire shall be
numbered among the nations of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now approach a period in our national history which has
ever been viewed, by opposing political parties, in a conflicting
spirit.&nbsp; The turbulent elements of</p>
<h3>THE CIVIL WARS</h3>
<p>were not allayed until Death had silenced the two great actors
in the tragic and murderous drama.&nbsp; The present volume,
devoted principally to local history, is not an appropriate organ
in which to discuss the merits and demerits of Charles I. and his
sturdy rival Cromwell.&nbsp; Charles was doubtless guilty of many
gross violations of his prerogative, and plunged into a reckless
course of misgovernment, accompanied with galling taxation, which
the people, beginning to learn the lessons of liberty, and to
understand the genius of the British constitution, would not
tamely submit to.</p>
<p>The ill-fated monarch, looking at him through the long vista
of two centuries, was greatly to be pitied.&nbsp; The son of a
king, who disregarded the instructions of his wise preceptor,
George Buchanan, and who, in his rule over the English people,
was prodigal, unprincipled, and tyrannical, he ascended the
throne with a corrupt education, and urged to despotism and
injustice by his infamous minister Villiers, Duke of Buckingham,
he speedily exhibited in his regal capacity, a passion for power,
which, as Macauley remarks, soon became &ldquo;a predominant
vice; idolatry to his regal prerogative, his governing
principle.&nbsp; The interests of the crown legitimated every
measure, and sanctified in his eye the widest deviation <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>from moral
rule.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the son of a kingly father who was
fond of cockfighting, and the brutal pleasures of inebriation,
who utterly neglected the affairs of state on the plea that
&ldquo;he should not make a slave of himself;&rdquo; who sold
titles and privileges of all kinds, that his vices might be fed;
and who basely deprived people of their patents, after having
paid for them to himself.&nbsp; These were only a small portion
of the sire&rsquo;s iniquities.&nbsp; What surprise then can be
entertained that Charles, his son, walked much in the
father&rsquo;s footsteps!&nbsp; Notwithstanding his despotic and
infatuated measures, to which all the evils of the civil wars may
be traced, yet he had many excellencies; and the closing scene of
his unhappy life proved that had he been blessed with a wiser
tutelage, and taught to govern with a just and righteous hand, he
might have descended into the tomb with virtue and honour,
embalmed in the grateful recollections of his country.</p>
<p>Of his powerful rival and successor much has, and still may be
said, in his praise and condemnation.&nbsp; His character,
however, singular and erratic as it was, was mixed, as that of
other men; and whilst he displayed a religious enthusiasm and
sanctity in most of his public acts, apparently impressed with
the conviction that he &ldquo;was doing <span
class="smcap">God</span> service&rdquo; in the course in which he
had embarked; yet the troublous events of his life&mdash;the
fears, anxieties, and weakness of his mortal nature&mdash;must
have convinced him, if he sincerely believed in the religion of
which he made so loud and trumpet-tongued a profession, that
&ldquo;he had done many things which he ought not to have done,
and left undone many things he ought to have done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now that we look calmly back upon Cromwell&rsquo;s life, we can
see much in his administrative policy that elevated the nation
during his transient rule, and that has shed its salutary
influences even upon the present generation; but the deep, dark
spot in his escutcheon&mdash;the murder of Charles&mdash;a crime
which harrows up the feelings, and rouses the indignation of all
right-minded men&mdash;that foul murder, with <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>all its cruel
and inhuman associations, blots out any excellency that he ever
did achieve, and stamps his character indelibly as that of a
religious, enthusiastic professor only, and not of a Christian
man.&nbsp; Charles may have been guilty, and deserving of
punishment for his misrule; but we have yet to learn that
Cromwell had plenary power to execute the mandate of <span
class="smcap">Jehovah</span>, and to have adopted the inspired
exclamation, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vengeance is
Mine</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the breaking out of the Civil Wars,&rdquo; says
Pennant, &ldquo;the whole of Shropshire, with few exceptions of
persons and none of places, adhered to the cause of
royalty.&nbsp; Oswestry, like the rest, was garrisoned for the
king.&nbsp; The town was defended by a new gate and draw-bridge;
the castle was fortified very strongly; and to prevent it from
being commanded by the church, in case of the capture of the
town, the steeple was pulled down, and a part of the sacred
edifice was also demolished.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same popular
author, with his fervid nationality, and strong royalist
principles, adds, with evident pride and delight, &ldquo;The
garrison consisted chiefly of Welsh (a people almost to a man
staunch in the cause of their sovereign).&rdquo;&nbsp; The
governor of Oswestry Castle at this disturbed period was a
Colonel Lloyd.&nbsp; Edward Lloyd, Esq., of Llanvorda, compounded
for his estates, as a royalist, in the sum of &pound;300; and at
the period of which we write (1643) he was in the prime of life,
and therefore physically able to assume the important command of
Governor of the Castle.&nbsp; Colonel Thomas Mytton, of Halston,
near Oswestry, a man well skilled in military art, and of great
personal courage, had united as a commander with the
Parliamentary forces, and first signalized himself in an assault
upon the town of Wem, which he seized and garrisoned; that place
soon became the centre from which attacks were directed against
the royalist garrisons in the neighbouring towns.&nbsp;
Mytton&rsquo;s success at Wem was achieved in the latter end of
August, 1643; and although he actively assisted the Parliamentary
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>army in
its attacks upon other parts of the country, he frequently
visited Wem to concert measures for fresh conquests.&nbsp; In
January of the following year, a plan was there determined upon
for a sudden and covert attack upon Oswestry.&nbsp; The story is
on record that Mytton well knew the <i>bon vivant</i> qualities
of the Governor of Oswestry.&nbsp; It was said of this royalist
Commandant, that in the social circle he was the life and soul of
the company, and that when he entered upon the convivialities of
the table, he found it a difficult matter to interrupt the rosy
hours by wending homewards.&nbsp; Colonel Mytton might know the
frailties of his gallant opponent; and, with a strategetic art
unworthy of a modern general, he devised a scheme for capturing
the Governor and seizing the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; The anecdote
proceeds to state, that Colonel Lloyd was to be invited to dinner
at the house of a neighbouring gentleman; and Mytton calculated
that no dinner invitation would be refused by good-humoured Col.
Lloyd.&nbsp; The plot included the spread of further net-work, in
which the unsuspecting Governor was to be surely caught.&nbsp;
His gastronomic and vinous attachments were to be plentifully
gratified; and whilst indulging in bacchanalian revels, a
military force, under Mytton&rsquo;s direction, was to enter the
dining room in which the innocent Governor was carousing, to
seize him, <i>vi et armis</i>, take him before his own garrison,
in Oswestry, and there compel him to issue orders to his officers
to surrender the town and castle.&nbsp; The plot, as we have
described it, was partly successful, but eventually failed.&nbsp;
Colonel Lloyd accepted the apparently-friendly invitation to
dinner; and all went merrily on with him for a brief
period.&nbsp; The detachment of troops was sent from Wem to take
him prisoner, so that the first act of the drama was nearly
completed.&nbsp; Whilst, however, the Parliamentarians were on
their way to surprise him, two of their scouts were seized by
some royalist friends; they confessed their share in the
treacherous plot; the Colonel was apprized of the danger he was
in, fled from the habitation of his Judas-like host, <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>reached the
&ldquo;post of honour&rdquo; which he had so improperly abandoned
for the pleasures of the table, and secured from the grasp of his
enemies both the town and castle.&nbsp; Colonel Lloyd&rsquo;s
misconduct was reported, it seems, to the royalist
commander-in-chief, who removed him from his important position,
and appointed as his successor Sir Absetts Shipman.</p>
<p>The parliamentary leaders were numerous and powerful, and they
were all fired with zeal and enthusiasm in the cause which they
espoused.&nbsp; The town of Oswestry was a military post of
distinction in their eyes; and to possess it was an achievement
&ldquo;devoutly to be wished.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oswestry stood on a
towering height, vigilantly watching the varied movements of the
parliamentary hosts, and protecting the communication between the
town and Wales.&nbsp; The opposite party were equally active and
observant.&nbsp; Colonel Mytton was well acquainted, from his
local connexion, with the strength and resources of the town, and
brought to his aid, in his meditated attack upon it, Sir Thomas
Fairfax, the equal to Cromwell in military tactics.&nbsp; In the
month of March, 1644, Fairfax and Mytton, with a strong force
under their command, made a sudden attack upon the town, which
was gallantly repulsed by Prince Rupert (the King&rsquo;s
nephew), who commanded the royalist troops in garrison.&nbsp;
This triumph was but of short duration, for the town was attacked
in a few months afterwards, and in this renewed onslaught, the
parliamentary forces were victors.&nbsp; The Battle of Oswestry,
if such it may be called, was fought on the 22nd June.&nbsp; The
Earl of Denbigh, a young parliamentary leader of some military
talents, and son of a nobleman who had died in defence of the
crown, suddenly left the main body of his army, and marched, with
his &ldquo;forlorn hope&rdquo; upon Oswestry, determined upon
taking the town by a <i>coup de main</i>.&nbsp; He reached the
vicinity in company with Colonel Mytton, about two o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon of June the 22nd, the former probably knowing,
from the &ldquo;false brethren,&rdquo; as spies were then called,
that <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>the
garrison was partly defenceless, the Governor having imprudently
gone to Shrewsbury with certain parliamentary prisoners.&nbsp;
Denbigh&rsquo;s force consisted merely of two hundred infantry,
and two troops of cavalry.&nbsp; The engagement was short and
sharp.&nbsp; After a hot affair of about two hours, in which Lord
Denbigh&rsquo;s artillery played fiercely upon the garrison with
small and great shot, a breach was made in the walls of the town,
and the infantry poured in, headed by Major Fraser, with the loss
of only one man killed and three wounded.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
New-gate,&rdquo; adds Pennant, &ldquo;was next demolished by the
cannon, when a young fellow, one George Cranage, went with a
hatchet, and cutting down the chains of the draw-bridge, enabled
the cavalry also to enter.&nbsp; The besieged made an attempt to
maintain the Church, but soon finding it untenable, fled to the
castle.&nbsp; Hither they were closely pursued, and the pioneers
were quickly called in to undermine its walls; in which, we are
informed, the skill as well as valour of Colonel Mytton was very
conspicuous.&nbsp; He was probably enabled, from his residence in
the neighbourhood, to direct the miners to proceed with most
effect.&nbsp; But the daring valour of Cranage again anticipated
these slower operations.&nbsp; He was persuaded to hang a
<i>Buttar</i> (a petard) at the castle-gate!&nbsp; Being well
animated with sack, he undertook this desperate attempt, crept
with the engine from house to house, till he got to that next to
the castle, fastened it to the gate, set fire to it, and escaped
unhurt!&nbsp; The gate was then burst open, and the garrison,
finding it impossible to make any further resistance, surrendered
the castle upon promise of quarter for their lives. * * * It is
greatly to the honour of the victorious commanders that they
restrained their soldiers from pillage, at the expense of a
gratuity of &pound;500.&nbsp; One can scarcely err in ascribing
this noble and uncommon act of mercy to Colonel Mytton&rsquo;s
solicitude for the welfare of his neighbours.&nbsp; The Earl
dispatched intelligence of his success to the Parliament.&nbsp;
His letter was read to the House of Commons, on the 27th <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>June, giving
an account of his taking the town and castle of Oswaldstree, with
400 prisoners and 300 arms.&nbsp; Thanks were voted to him for
this his good service, and former testimonies of affection to the
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; The circumstantial narrative proceeds to
state that &ldquo;his Lordship returned, after this exploit, to
his main army at Drayton,&rdquo; and left Colonel Mytton in
defence of the town.&nbsp; The fall of Oswestry was a severe blow
to the royal party.&nbsp; Besides opening a door for the
reduction of North Wales to the power of the Parliament, it
lowered them in the scale of public opinion, a loss, in the
declining posture of their affairs, of incalculable
importance.&nbsp; Active and energetic as were both Lord Denbigh
and Colonel Mytton, in their attack upon Oswestry, still they did
not escape the slanders even of their own party.&nbsp; The Earl
of Denbigh seems to have felt their calumnies acutely, for a few
months after the siege his Lordship wrote a letter to Mytton,
vindicating the gallantry of both; which we subjoin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;COLL. MITTON,</p>
<p>I will not trouble you with the injuries that are offered to
you and myselfe, by the Committe of Wem.&nbsp; I am sure you have
deserved more of the Parliament then the rest of that
Committe.&nbsp; Captaine Clive, as I am informed, reports I was
not at the takeing of Oswaldstre, and that my horse stood att too
great a distance; I am sure they entred with the foote; but the
false representations of passages heere shall not divert me from
those occasions that may fully expresse me to be</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">Your faithfull frend and servant,<br
/>
DENBIGH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condor, 29th Oct. 1644.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this period the King&rsquo;s position was critical and
alarming.&nbsp; In the early part of the month he determined to
take refuge within the walls of Shrewsbury, in his march through
Worcester and Bewdley.&nbsp; Waller, the parliamentary leader,
hearing of Charles&rsquo;s movements, broke up from Oxford, and
hastened in the direction of Shropshire.&nbsp; On this
intelligence the King left Shrewsbury, and retraced his
steps.&nbsp; The battle of Copredy Bridge (June 29th) terminated
in the defeat of the parliamentary forces; and in July the Earl
of Denbigh, encouraged by his success at Oswestry, drew his
forces towards Shrewsbury, but <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>was repulsed by the royalist army,
with a loss of 120 of his men.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s defeat at
Marston Moor (July 3rd) added, however, to his disasters and
dangers.&nbsp; The whole of Shropshire was in arms, and jeopardy
and distress stared every man in the face.</p>
<p>Among the prisoners taken in the late disaster at Oswestry was
Francis Newport, Esq., who had served both in the short and long
Parliaments.&nbsp; The historians of Shrewsbury have furnished us
with an interesting account of this distinguished man:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Newport was son and heir of Sir Richard
Newport, of High Ercall, one of the knights of the shire.&nbsp;
This young gentleman was but just eligible to serve in
parliament, having arrived at full age only on the 23rd day of
the preceding February.&nbsp; He manifested the same ardent
loyalty which actuated his father: and ventured, with rare but
honourable gallantry, to vote for the acquittal of Lord
Strafford, at a time when such votes exposed those who gave them
to no small personal hazard; the populace, with their usual
toleration of sentiments differing from their own, denouncing all
such, fifty-six in number, as <i>Straffordians</i>; and exposing
their names to execration and danger by public placards.&nbsp;
Mr. Newport was soon expelled from the house as a
<i>malignant</i>; appeared in arms against the parliament; and
was among the prisoners taken at Oswestry, on the capture of that
town by the Earl of Denbigh and Colonel Mytton.&nbsp; It is
needless to say that he suffered very considerably in his estate:
being obliged to compound in the large sum of &pound;5284, in
addition to &pound;3287, and &pound;170 a year extorted from his
father for the same crime of loyalty.&nbsp; Yet though attached
to the monarchy, he was friendly to the rights of the subject;
and it is not a little remarkable, that he who had suffered so
deeply for the first Charles, was so much disgusted by the base
and arbitary measures of the two succeeding kings, by the last of
whom he had the honour of being dismissed from the office of lord
lieutenant of this county; that he was a <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>great
promoter of the Revolution, and was excepted, by the abdicated
monarch, from his general pardon.&nbsp; He was created earl of
Bradford by king William; and died Sept., 1708, in the
eighty-ninth year of his age.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The town of Oswestry was now in the hands of the
parliamentarians, under the temporary Governorship of Colonel
Mytton, but was not long permitted to remain quietly in the power
of the victors.&nbsp; Only one short week elapsed before a
formidable attempt was made by part of the royalist army, under
Colonel Marrow, a skilful and intrepid commander, to retake the
town, and drive the parliamentary forces from their
position.&nbsp; Colonel Marrow invested the town with 3,500
infantry, and 1,500 cavalry, and maintained a close siege for the
three following days.&nbsp; This sudden assault greatly
embarrassed Colonel Mytton, whose only hope for relief was from
Sir Thomas Myddleton, his kinsman by marriage, who was then
stationed at Knutsford, in Cheshire, more than fifty miles
distant.&nbsp; Colonel Mytton, however, succeeded in making Sir
Thomas acquainted with his position in less than twelve hours
from the commencement of the royalist attack; and the gallant
knight, who was heartily engaged in the parliamentary cause,
immediately mustered three regiments, namely, Booth&rsquo;s,
Mainwaring&rsquo;s, and Croxen&rsquo;s, with Major Lothian at the
head of the reserve, and marching onwards with all speed, reached
in two days within sight of Oswestry&mdash;it is supposed between
Halston and Whittington.&nbsp; During this interval of time the
royalists had not obtained full possession of the town, though
consisting, as Sir Thomas Myddleton says, &ldquo;of the most
valiant commanders and soldiers, drawn out of the garrisons of
Chester, Cheshire, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Ludlow, Denbighshire,
Flintshire, and other places.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had possessed
themselves of the Church, but had made no inroad upon the
Castle.&nbsp; Myddleton&rsquo;s approach having been made known,
Colonel Marrow marched out from the town, determined to attack
him before his troops could recruit themselves <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>after their
long march.&nbsp; &ldquo;They had taken the passage of water
neere to Whittington,&rdquo; says Sir Thomas, in his letter to
Lenthall, the Speaker, &ldquo;and very furiously assaulted and
charged us, but were repulsed and forced to retire, through the
courage of our horse, who most courageously entertained the
enemy.&nbsp; Three several times the skirmish was doubtful;
either side being forced so often to retreat.&nbsp; But in the
end, our foot forces, coming up, relieved the horse, beat back
the enemy, and pursued them with such force, that our horse being
thereby encouraged, which indeed was formerly weary, joining with
the foot, they put the enemy to an absolute flight, in which we
pursued them five miles towards Shrewsbury, to a place called
&lsquo;Felton Heath,&rsquo; and where we remained after their
flight, again masters of the field.&nbsp; In the skirmish with
the enemy, and in the pursuite, we lost several of our horse,
some of our troopers, but never a footman, which I am yet
informed of.&nbsp; As for the enemy they lost several stout men;
had many of them taken prisoners, some of them being of great
quality, as the Lord Newport&rsquo;s eldest son; and besides, in
their flight, such was their haste, that we found in our pursuite
the highway as it were strewed with bread, cheese, bacon, and
other good provisions; clothes, and such necessary appurtenances
to an army, besides some whole veals and muttons, new
killed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Thomas adds, that &ldquo;his forces
followed up their blow nearly to Shrewsbury, and that Majors
Manley and Whitney were afterwards taken under the walls of that
town, in pursuite of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This affair closed the struggle between the royalist and
parliamentary forces for the possession of Oswestry.&nbsp; On the
very day on which Sir Thomas Myddleton raised the siege, Prince
Rupert was signally defeated at Marston Moor, with the loss of
ten thousand men killed and taken prisoners.&nbsp; Colonel Mytton
must subsequently have delegated his command as temporary
Governor of Oswestry, as we find him soon afterwards actively
engaged in commanding the parliamentary <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>troops in the
conquest of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; That event happened early in 1645,
when the town was placed in the hands of the
parliamentarians.&nbsp; At this period we find Mytton named, in
several public documents, as Major-General in the parliamentary
army, and some time afterwards as Commander-in-chief of the
forces in North Wales.</p>
<p>All the historical records referring to this period give
evidence of the arduous duties of General Mytton, and of the
difficulties which he had suffered in maintaining his hold upon
Oswestry.&nbsp; A letter which we here give indicates the straits
he was in, and at the same time the friendly offers of support
made to him in the county.&nbsp; The letter is from a Mr. Edward
Mynshull, of Bearstone, near Drayton:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hono<sup>ble</sup> S<sup>r</sup>,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berson, April 25th, 1645.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
fall of Shrewsbury into the power of the Parliament was marked by
&ldquo;a solemn thanksgiving throughout the City of
London,&rdquo; on the 12th March; Mytton was summoned to appear
before the House of Commons on the 29th of that month, and
&ldquo;Master Speaker, in the name, and by the command of the
whole House, gave him hearty thanks for his many and faithfull
services done to the state; giving him all encouragement to
persist in the same: especially for that gallant service of
Shrewsbury; assuring him that he shall never want the
encouragement of the House of Parliament in his
undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Mytton had evidently embarked all his energies in the
parliamentary cause; yet notwithstanding the tribute paid to him
by the Commons, it does not appear that he obtained from that
source any more substantial honours.&nbsp; This neglect seems to
have given him much pain.&nbsp; A letter to him from the Duke of
Northumberland, about this period, shews that even the
Governorship of Oswestry was not actually accorded to him till
late in the year 1645.&nbsp; The letter we subjoin:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;S<sup>r,</sup></p>
<p>By an indisposition in my health, I have not beene able for
some dayes to attend the Committie of both kingdomes, so as I can
not give you so good an account of your businesse as I desired,

<p style="text-align: right">NORTHUMBERLAND.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my very loveing Freind, Col. Mytton.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conquest of Shrewsbury, by the parliamentary troops, is
generally acknowledged to have been achieved by the gallantry and
superior tactics of General Mytton; and having <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>accomplished
so signal a service for his party, he naturally expected, now
that the Governorship of that town was vacant, that the office
would he conferred upon him.&nbsp; His ancient relation to the
town, his ancestors having been inhabitants and burgesses for
upwards of four centuries, added strength to his claim.&nbsp; All
his important services to the Parliament were, however, of no
weight, and the Governorship was bestowed upon another man.&nbsp;
We are told that &ldquo;Colonel Mytton&rsquo;s politics were
getting very fast out of fashion.&nbsp; He had sided with the
Parliament only for the limitation of prerogative, not for the
subversion of the monarchy.&nbsp; The Presbyterians, to whom, it
appears, he belonged, had no insurmountable objections to the
office of a king, provided he was under their controul: or to a
national establishment of religion, if its revenues were at their
disposal.&nbsp; But those who commence important changes in a
state have seldom the satisfaction of reaping the fruit of their
labours.&nbsp; Spirits more ardent, with views more extensive,
step in between them and the consummation of their
designs.&rdquo;&nbsp; With Sir William Waller, another of the
ablest and most successful commanders of the Presbyterian party,
he could say, &ldquo;after the expence of so much blood and
treasure, all the difference between our former and present
estate is this, that before-time, under the complaint of a
slavery we lived like freemen; and now, under the notion of a
freedom, we live like slaves, enforced by continual taxes and
oppressions, to maintain and feed on our miseries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although General Mytton had been thus ungratefully treated by
the Parliament, he still occupied his military position, for we
find that in 1648 he was engaged with Sir Thomas Myddleton in the
attack upon Caernarvonshire and Anglesey.&nbsp; In June of that
year the Speaker of the House of Commons communicated to him a
letter, highly approving his &ldquo;good and faithfull
service&rdquo; against &ldquo;Sir John Owen and his rebellious
crewe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The letter referred to is a curiosity, as it
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>shows the
blasphemous freedom which Cromwell&rsquo;s parliament took with
the holy name of <span class="smcap">God</span>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,</p>

<p>&ldquo;June the 13th, 1648.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lenthall, the Speaker, was profuse, as we have shewn, in
compliments, but still no substantial mark of favour upon General
Mytton was bestowed.&nbsp; The Committee to whom the appointment
of Governor of Shrewsbury Castle had been referred had long
before found &ldquo;reasons of weight to put another&rdquo; in
that office, after having held it in their own hands for some
time.&nbsp; In 1647 the Governorship was filled by Humphrey
Mackworth, Esq., of Betton, a Presbyterian, and Colonel in the
army, who occupied the post till his death, in 1654, and having
been one of Cromwell&rsquo;s Privy Council, was buried in Henry
VII.&rsquo;s Chapel in Westminster Abbey, on the 26th December,
with great magnificence.&nbsp; He was succeeded in office at
Shrewsbury by Thomas Hunt, Esq., representative of the town in
Parliament, and a Colonel in the army.&nbsp; Mytton retired to
London, from what immediate cause there is no record to show; but
some writers assert that he resigned his command.&nbsp; In 1651
we find that the Parliament again solicited Major-General
Mytton&rsquo;s services, the following <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>letter having been forwarded to him
by the President Bradshawe.&nbsp; The kingdom was disturbed at
this period by the Scottish Covenanters, under the nominal
command of Charles II.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;S<sup>r,</sup></p>
<p>The Scotts army being now entred into England, and bending
their course towards those parts where wee know you have a good
interest, wee conceive your presence there may bee of use for the
service of the Commonwealth; wee therefore desire you forthwith
to repaire into the Countie of Salop, and there, with the rest of
your fellow Commissioners, doe your best endeavour, and put out
your interest there for the raiseing of what force of horse and
foot you can, for the service of the Commonwealth in this present
exigency of affaires.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whitehall, 14th August, 1651.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Major General Thomas Mytton.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most probably by this time General Mytton had grown tired with
the hard toils of intestine warfare, and become disgusted with
the faithlessness of the men whom he had so ardently and
faithfully served; for we do not find that he complied with
Bradshawe&rsquo;s letter, or took any further part in public
affairs.&nbsp; He died in the metropolis in the year 1656, and
his body was taken down to Shrewsbury, and interred in St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church there.</p>
<h3>THE RESTORATION.</h3>
<p>It is unnecessary here to do more than merely advert to the
unhappy close of Charles I.&rsquo;s reign, the triumphs of
Cromwell, and the bold and manly efforts made by Charles II. to
obtain the Crown which had been so violently wrested from his
father.&nbsp; Although Cromwell had made himself Lord Protector
of England, Scotland, and Ireland, yet he reposed not on a bed of
roses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every party in the kingdom soon became
disgusted with Cromwell&rsquo;s dominion.&nbsp; The royalists
were indignant to see the ancient monarchy usurped by an upstart
who had no hereditary claim upon their allegiance; <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>the
republicans were mortified to see all their blood and efforts,
which had been spent for the setting-up of the Commonwealth,
lavished only for the support of a government which, in
everything but the name, was a most despotic monarchy; the
Presbyterians were chagrined at the favour of their rivals, the
Independents, and at a general toleration of every religious
denomination (except the Church of England).&rdquo;&nbsp;
Conspiracies and plots were hatched in many parts of the land;
and the Protector was kept on the alert by daily intelligence
that the exiled king would challenge the usurper, and claim the
British throne as soon as a favourable opportunity presented
itself for so bold an enterprise.&nbsp; Cromwell, however, after
various struggles with the royalist forces, was summoned to
&ldquo;the house appointed for all men living.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was succeeded, for a brief period, by his son Richard, who
speedily retired from public life.&nbsp; General Monk, who had
been an intrepid commander both of the royalist and the
parliamentary forces, and who possessed powerful influence in the
country, on the death of the Protector Cromwell wisely threw the
weight of that influence into the royalist scale, and adopted
measures at once to bring back Charles II. from France to
England.&nbsp; Upon that joyful event all ranks hastened to
return to their allegiance, and on the 29th of May, 1660, Charles
II. set his foot again upon British soil, and immediately assumed
the functions of sovereignty.</p>
<p>During the events to which we have been adverting the town of
Oswestry suffered much privation and distress by the feuds and
divisions into which all classes of men were thrown.&nbsp; A
letter from Mr. John Griffith to Major-General Mytton, dated
January 7th, 1650, shows that Oswestry was enduring much
hardship.&nbsp; The letter, which is copied from the Halston
MSS., is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Honor&rsquo;d Sir,</p>
<p>I receaved a note from * * * * to write unto yo<sup>r</sup>
honor concerning our sufferings.&nbsp; I presume yo<sup>r</sup>
honor <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

releeved is better known to you then to us.&nbsp; The Baylifes
and the rest of the sufferinge people of Oswestree depende much
upon your assistance, and hope yo<sup>r</sup> honor will have a
fitt opportunity to doe this poor towne good. * * * I shall make
bould to put yo<sup>r</sup> honor in mind of your promise to draw
a petition to the Parliament w<sup>th</sup> yo<sup>r</sup> owne

<p style="text-align: right">Yo<sup>r</sup> servant,<br />
JOHN GRIFFITH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Osw., the 7th of January, 1650.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Honrable Major Generall Mytton, at
London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no records extant showing precisely the position of
civil and military affairs, as regards the town of Oswestry, in
the struggles of Charles II. for the Crown.&nbsp; The
parliamentary party held firm possession of all towns which they
had taken, and against Charles they fought as fiercely as against
his murdered father.&nbsp; Whatsoever the position of Oswestry
was at the period to which we are referring, that of a valiant
neighbour, Sir Thomas Myddleton, of Chirk Castle, was dangerous
and deeply painful.&nbsp; In 1659, upon the royalists of
Cheshire, headed by Sir George Booth, declaring in favour of
Charles, the venerable old man, then eighty years of age, decided
in favour of the ancient constitution, believing monarchy to be
indispensable to the settlement of the nation, and proclaimed
Charles II. at Wrexham.&nbsp; For this act he suffered severely,
but was named afterwards as Commander-in-chief of the Counties of
North Wales, and as Governor of Shrewsbury, although this latter
nomination seems to have embarrassed Sir Edward Hyde, Chief
Minister of Charles II., as likely to clash with the views of his
friend Lord Newport, who had ever been a staunch friend to the
royalist cause.</p>
<p>The events of public interest that occurred in connection with
the town subsequent to the Restoration were &ldquo;few and far
between.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most important act in Charles
II.&rsquo;s reign was his grant in 1673 of a Charter, which,
looking at <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>the privileges it confers upon the town, is considered
by some to be the Magna Charta of Oswestry.&nbsp; Its importance
to the borough, as its provisions are still acted upon in the
leading Law-Court of the town, justifies us in giving a correct
abridgment of it:&mdash;</p>
<h3>The Charter</h3>
<p>was granted</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;to the ancient Borough and Corporation of

</blockquote>
<p>The privileges secured to the inhabitants of the borough by
this Charter must, at the time of its being granted, have been
very valuable, and no doubt contributed greatly to the good
government and prosperity of the town, during subsequent
times.&nbsp; Some of such privileges have been superseded by the
provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act, 5 &amp; 6, William
4th, cap. 76, entitled &ldquo;An Act to provide for the
Regulation of Municipal Corporations in England and Wales,&rdquo;
and other modern enactments; but others still remain, although
the value and convenience of them appear in some degree to be
overlooked.&nbsp; The Charter secures some peculiar privileges
with respect to trade which may not probably harmonize with
modern views and notions; but the privileges of trying at Quarter
Sessions all offences, except felonies, committed within the
borough, and of suing for debts, unlimited in amount, in the
Court of Record, ought not to be regarded otherwise than as
precious relics of byegone times.&nbsp; It is true, that the
Court of Quarter <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Sessions has been constantly and regularly held by the
most able Recorder, J. R. Kenyon, Esq.; but the Court of Record
has of late years been so seldom resorted to, that on a late
occasion, when a cause was tried before it, a local newspaper
referred to it with special wonder, hinting its surprise that, in
a place where the weapons of legal warfare were so easily
obtained, the inhabitants should so long have ceased to use them,
and to remain in peace amongst themselves, without any legal
strife in a Court of Record.&nbsp; Although, however, debts
without limit, as regards amount, may be sued for, the final
process of the Court is confined to the borough, and cannot be
put in force beyond its boundary; and this circumstance,
connected also with the facilities for the recovery of debts
afforded by the Small Debts Act, has rendered resort to the Court
of Record less frequent than, under other circumstances, it
doubtless would have been; still, to have it is a privilege, as
is also the exemption from serving on Juries at the Assizes, or
County Quarter Sessions, secured by the Charter.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Restoration</span> brought with it, of
course, the ascendancy of loyal subjects and monarchical
principles in all parts of the realm.&nbsp; Charles, however, did
not make the wisest use of the power and influence he had newly
acquired; and the closing hours of his life proved that his
religious principles, unfixed and vacillating, were ill adapted
to the requirements of the age.&nbsp; Howsoever much other parts
of the kingdom were disturbed during this reign, the town of
Oswestry would seem to have resumed a tranquil position: the
injury and damage sustained in it during the many years of
disquietude and war were partially restored; the ancient Church
was gradually repaired; but the Castle, so dilapidated and broken
down, was permitted to lie in ruins; the crown made no effort to
restore it; and by degrees its shattered walls and fallen columns
were carried away by nocturnal depredators, until at length the
vestiges of the fortress consisted of little more than the mound
still left in our sight.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>In
1681, only four years before Charles&rsquo;s death, a polemic
scene was enacted in Oswestry, which, from the celebrity of the
parties engaged in it, forms no uninteresting feature in the
history of the town.&nbsp; Charles&rsquo;s reign was marked by
odious political intolerance and injustice.&nbsp; He aimed at
absolutism, and was as regardless of religious liberty as of
religion itself.&nbsp; The controversy to which we have alluded
occurred in the Guildhall of Oswestry, in September, 1681, and
was conducted throughout in a spirit of candour and moderation
not frequently to be witnessed in that turbulent period.&nbsp;
The leading parties engaged were Dr. Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph
(the prelate who preached the first sermon in the Chapel Royal to
William III.), and the distinguished Philip Henry, of Broad Oak,
Flintshire (father of the erudite and evangelical Matthew Henry,
the Commentator on the Bible).&nbsp; Other nonconformist
Ministers were present, and took part in the proceedings,
especially Mr. James Owen, then of Oswestry&mdash;but afterwards
of Shrewsbury Seminary for the education of Dissenting
Ministers&mdash;a man of considerable acquirements and genuine
piety.&nbsp; The Bishop, upon his elevation to the episcopal
chair, was desirous of securing the conformity of those who
dissented, and &ldquo;that he might do it with the cords of a
man, he resolved to reason the matter with them, and endeavour to
effect their conviction by discourse, in which he had a very
great facility both by learning and temper.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
account from which we derive these particulars goes on to state,
that &ldquo;one of the most eminent nonconformist ministers in
his diocese was Mr. James Owen, of Oswestry.&nbsp; The Bishop had
several interviews with Mr. Owen in private.&nbsp; At last he
appointed a meeting to be held in the Town Hall, Oswestry, on
Tuesday, the 27th of September, 1681, at which he requested Mr.
Owen to give an account &lsquo;by what right he exercised the
ministry, not having episcopal ordination.&rsquo;&nbsp; He also
directed him to procure any other ministers he could to assist
him, for &lsquo;he would be glad to hear what any of them had to
say for themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Owen sought the co-operation
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of Mr.
Henry, which, after much hesitation, was granted; to whom also
was joined Mr. Jonathan Roberts, &lsquo;a plain man of great
integrity, and a very good scholar.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the day
appointed the Bishop made his appearance with the famous Henry
Dodwell.&nbsp; In those days of intolerance, some parties had
refrained from engaging in the controversy, &lsquo;lest it might
be prejudicial to their liberty.&nbsp; The Bishop, however, was
pleased to promise that no thing which should be said, by way of
argument, should be any way turned to the prejudice of the
disputants, nor advantage taken of it to give them
trouble.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was convened a large number of the
gentry and clergy of the neighbourhood, the magistrates of the
town, and a great concourse of people.&nbsp; The discussion
lasted from two in the afternoon till between seven and eight at
night.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much was said, pro and con, touching the
identity of bishops and presbyters, the bishoping and unbishoping
of Timothy and Titus, &amp;c.&nbsp; It was managed with a great
deal of liberty, and not under the strict laws of
disputation.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bishop won golden opinions
from all parties on account of the gravity, calmness, and
evenness of spirit&rsquo; with which he conducted his part; while
he seems to have been so much gratified with the temper of his
opponents, as to have formed from that time a most intimate
friendship with Mr. Henry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report does not
inform us whether the Bishop was convinced by the arguments of
the nonconformists.&nbsp; That Philip Henry retained his opinions
is undeniable; for he never ceased advocating, with Christian
zeal and moderation, the principles of nonconformity.&nbsp; It is
gratifying, however, to read of so tolerant and well-conducted a
disputation in so persecuting an age; it speaks much in favor of
the just and beneficent spirit of Bishop Lloyd.</p>
<p>The reign of James II. offers no particular incident in
relation to Oswestry.&nbsp; As a sovereign he was worthless and
dangerous.&nbsp; His darling objects were, the establishment,
throughout the land, of the Roman Catholic religion, and the
restriction of popular freedom.&nbsp; During his brief occupation
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>of the
throne he paid a visit to Shrewsbury and Whitchurch; and on his
way from the metropolis sojourned at Ludlow for a night, and
passed through the Strettons.&nbsp; The people of Shrewsbury had
not been favoured with a royal visit for nearly half a century,
and were now disposed to give the monarch a cordial
reception.&nbsp; All the public functionaries were trained and
disciplined as to duty, for an incident had occurred in the royal
progress, so ludicrous in character, that the Shrewsbury
corporation resolved it should not be re-enacted amid their loyal
congratulations.&nbsp; The story to which we refer may be true or
fabulous; but it is too good not to be connected with a notice of
James&rsquo;s reign: and, after all, the mayor of the town where
the scene is laid, in adopting literally the promptings of the
learned recorder, was not, to use a common phrase, &ldquo;so
great a fool as he seemed to be.&rdquo;&nbsp; If King James had
received those promptings in a wise spirit&mdash;mirth-exciting
as they must have been&mdash;he might have been a good sovereign,
and had around him loyal and devoted subjects.</p>
<p>The mayor whose absurdities we are about to describe is said
to have been both illiterate and dull, incapable of reading or
remembering an address.&nbsp; It was settled therefore, says the
tale, that the recorder should stand behind him, to set him right
if he happened to be out.&nbsp; When they (the corporation) were
ushered into the royal presence, and the chief magistrate was
about to commence his harangue, as he appeared somewhat sheepish
and embarassed, his friendly monitor whispered in his ear,
&ldquo;<i>Hold up your head</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>and look like a
man</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mistaking this for the beginning of his
speech, he boldly stared the king in the face, and roared out,
&ldquo;<i>Hold</i>, <i>up your head</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>and look
like a man</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at the frightful blunder
just made, the recorder whispered to the chief magistrate (who at
this moment must have resembled the celebrated Mayor of Garrat,
with two nosegays in his coat), &ldquo;<i>What the d&mdash;l do
you mean</i>, <i>sir</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; The mayor, as stolid as
ever, and <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>nothing abashed, thundered out the recorder&rsquo;s
exclamation as boldly as before.&nbsp; The recorder, indignant
and irritated, muttered, &ldquo;By heavens, sir, you&rsquo;ll
ruin us all!&rdquo;&nbsp; His worship, taking this to be a
continuance of the speech, and still staring his majesty full in
the face, with a yet louder voice repeated, &ldquo;<i>By
heavens</i>, <i>sir</i>, <i>you&rsquo;ll ruin us
all</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Even kingly patience could bear this no
longer, and rising, his majesty in an angry tone demanded what
was the meaning of this jargon? when the recorder laid before him
&ldquo;the facts of the case,&rdquo; and the king passed the
affair by with a gracious smile.</p>
<h3>THE REVOLUTION.</h3>
<p>The Revolution of 1688 brought over to England William III.;
and his reign was followed by that of &ldquo;good Queen
Anne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her reign has been termed the Augustan era of
English literature, as it was graced with the polished writings
of Sir Isaac Newton, Addison, Steele, Farquar (who laid the scene
of his comedy, &ldquo;<i>The Recruiting Officer</i>,&rdquo; in
Shrewsbury, and who, in his epistle dedicatory, first used the
lively sentiment, &ldquo;To all friends round the Wrekin,&rdquo;
now one of the social laws of Salop), of Vanbrugh, Prior, Pope,
Parnell, Garth, Gay, <i>cum multis aliis</i>.&nbsp; Instructed as
the nation was by these and other eminent men, still bigotry and
enthusiasm were evidenced by many in matters of religion and
politics.&nbsp; In the year 1709 the nation was thrown into a
gentle ferment by the indiscreet conduct of the government
towards an obscure clergyman named Sacheverell (who had long been
starving on a poor curacy in London), in consequence of his
having preached and published two scurrilous and intemperate
sermons, of which red-hot politics were the staple.&nbsp; He was
summoned to the bar of the House of Lords, and impeached.&nbsp;
The Whig ministry viewed his attacks with alarm, and he was
sentenced not to preach for three years.&nbsp; This persecution,
as the proceedings of the government were called at once
martyrised Sacheverell, who suddenly found himself famous.&nbsp;
A gentleman residing in the neighbourhood of Oswestry, Robert <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Lloyd, Esq.,
of Aston, sympathized with the suffering Sacheverell, and became
his friend.&nbsp; Mr. Lloyd had been the doctor&rsquo;s pupil at
Magdalen College, Oxford; and as the rectory of Sylattyn, in his
gift, became vacant at this juncture, he presented it to the
high-church meteor.&nbsp; This was doubtless a god-send to the
doctor, who set off from London, to take possession of his new
living, with all the state which a corrupt popularity could give
to him.&nbsp; A Tory writer of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign tells us
that &ldquo;he entered upon his triumphant progress to
Shropshire.&nbsp; He was magnificently entertained at Oxford by
the University, and received in the other great towns he passed
through (Shrewsbury and Oswestry included) with the loud
acclamations and joyful congratulations of the people, upon his
deliverance from whig persecution.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Shrewsbury the
crier was sent about to proclaim his arrival, and the bells were
rung in honour of the event.&nbsp; As he passed through Oswestry,
it is related, the crowd assembled to witness his arrival was so
great, that an enthusiastic old woman, a great dabbler in
politics and religion, no doubt, was so excited in her endeavours
to obtain a sight of the distinguished bigot, that she succeeded
only in catching a passing glance at his figure and
periwig.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could see only part of the holy
man,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but I console myself with
having had a sight of his ever-blessed wig as he rode
along.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sort of mummery was not confined to
Oswestry.&nbsp; In many towns people were desirous to have their
new-born infants christened with a name so revered; which, having
been transmitted through succeeding generations, is not yet
extinct in this county.&nbsp; On his return to London he met with
nothing but laudations, except at Worcester, where, by the
direction of Bishop Lloyd, a suitable rebuff was administered to
him.&nbsp; Of Dr. Sacheverell nothing more was heard worthy of
transcription.&nbsp; Like most other men whose popularity is
created by intolerant doctrines in religion or politics, he
speedily found that his sudden greatness was as mutable as it was
undeserved.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>The
death of Queen Anne, in 1714, secured to the kingdom the
Brunswick Dynasty.&nbsp; The Act of Settlement, passed in the
reign of William III., provided that the crown of Great Britain
should henceforth be held only by Protestant Princes.&nbsp; James
Stuart, Queen Anne&rsquo;s brother, known more popularly as the
Pretender, could not reign in England because he was a Roman
Catholic, and George, Duke of Brunswick, and Elector of Hanover,
a Protestant Prince, whose mother was grand-daughter of James I.,
became King of Great Britain.&nbsp; The Brunswick succession has
continued till the present time, the united kingdom deriving
especial benefits from the reigns of the three Georges, of
William IV., and of Queen Victoria.&nbsp; Under the sway of
George III. enlarged freedom, civil and religious, was extended
to his subjects; arts, science, and commerce flourished, and the
people made rapid advancement in religious and moral
improvement.&nbsp; The memorable wish of the venerable monarch
George III., &ldquo;That every one of his subjects should read
and possess the Bible&rdquo;&mdash;a far more generous sentiment
than that of the French King who desired to see the day when
every one of his subjects should be able to put a fowl into the
pot once a week&mdash;was largely realized through the
instrumentality of Robert Raikes, Dr. Bell, and Joseph Lancaster,
the great promoters of education in the land, and by, also, the
foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society, whose
distribution of the Scriptures gave an impulse to religious and
benevolent efforts which have been increasing in usefulness and
efficiency to the present day.&nbsp; Under the auspices of George
IV. the nation derived numerous blessings, deficient as he was of
many of the bright qualities that ought to shine in the moral
diadem of a British King.&nbsp; The reign of William
IV.&mdash;the Sailor King, as he has been familiarly but
appropriately called&mdash;was rendered illustrious by his
intense regard for the interests of the people, and his sanction
to the Second Great Charter of British rights.&nbsp; Under the
mild and gracious rule of our beloved Sovereign <span
class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span>, the rights and privileges of
Britons are held sacred; literature, arts, and science have
acquired &ldquo;a <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>more than double sway;&rdquo; commerce and manufactures,
in a multiplicity of forms, for the comfort and luxury of
mankind, have careered onwards with giant steps, that have
astonished and delighted the wisest and the best; the social
comforts of all classes of the British community are rendered
almost boundless by the progress of invention, the ingenuity of
mechanical skill, and the unceasing activity of all industrial
pursuits; the unrighteous laws that prohibited the importation of
corn have been abolished; free trade in bread has been
established with all the nations of the earth; ancient grinding
monopolies have been destroyed; national imposts reduced; the
just demands of the people speedily granted; harsh feudal laws,
carrying with them inhuman punishments, have been blotted out of
the Statute-book; &ldquo;man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man,&rdquo;
under the sanction of Acts of Parliament, has been softened if
not wholly subdued; the just principle of national brotherhood,
inculcated by divine precept, has gained vital force; religion
has become less sectarian, and more thoroughly Christian in
profession and practice; the helping hand of man to his brother
man, in the hour of necessity, is seen now more actively at work
than ever; the people at large are united as one man, in all
great designs of philanthropy and benevolence, and in all
puissant combinations against injustice and oppression; our <span
class="smcap">Queen</span> and her enlightened and virtuous <span
class="smcap">Consort</span> are ever watchful for the
country&rsquo;s weal.&nbsp; The reign of <span
class="smcap">Victoria</span> is thus far the brightest page of
regal history, because it has been pre-eminently the best.&nbsp;
We may sum up in the eloquent language of Dr. Southwood
Smith:&mdash;&ldquo;We live in a glorious age.&nbsp; The rapidity
of the progress of liberal opinion, and I will add, of liberal
feeling, within these few years has been unexampled in the
history of our race.&nbsp; Sometimes indeed the tide of
improvement like the tide of the ocean may appear to have
receded; but soon, as if deriving strength from its momentary
retreat, slow, majestic, irresistible, it has rolled beyond its
former limit; but, unlike its type, it has not returned, <i>and
it will not return</i>, to the boundary it has passed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Topographical History.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Oswestry</span> is one of the most
interesting of the English Border towns, as we have already
endeavoured to show; its early history, in various conflicting
ages, being crowded with incidents to give to it a lasting
renown.&nbsp; In its present state it offers numerous claims to
public attention; and the time does not seem far distant when it
will take its rank among the more flourishing towns of the
empire.&nbsp; Having railway communication direct with the
metropolis, the great seats of manufacturing industry in the
northern counties, and by a new line of conveyance, both of
passengers and goods, <i>via</i> the rapidly-rising town and port
of Birkenhead, with the sister kingdom, its importance and
improvement will quickly increase.&nbsp; Nor is the contemplated
railway extension from Oswestry to Welshpool and Newtown to be
overlooked, as that may soon lead to the still further
construction of a railway forming a junction with the projected
line from the latter place to the busy town of Llanidloes, and
stretching onward till it reaches the great harbour in course of
formation at Milford Haven.&nbsp; With such &ldquo;means and
appliances&rdquo; the trade and commerce of Oswestry are not
likely to retrograde; and although we possess not the poetical
and sanguine temperament of Griffith of Glyn Ceiriog, who, some
centuries ago, fancied that &ldquo;in merchandise it resembled
Cheapside,&rdquo; in London, yet we have no doubt that Oswestry,
which is now prospering commercially, and diffusing much good,
both morally and religiously, will advance steadily forward in
the <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>march
of general and social improvement.&nbsp; We are too gallant not
heartily to concur on another point with the Welsh poet just
quoted.&nbsp; In his days, he says, &ldquo;The handsomest women,
and the most becomingly drest, are those of
Oswestry.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we did not unhesitatingly applaud this
opinion of a Welshman, we should consider ourselves unworthy the
name of Englishmen!</p>
<p>The site of Oswestry is remarkable.&nbsp; It stands upon more
elevated ground than any other town in Shropshire, being 450 feet
above the level of the sea.&nbsp; Its commanding position freely
exposes to the gaze of the delighted spectator a range of
landscape scenery which, for variety, beauty, and grandeur,
cannot be excelled in any part of the kingdom.&nbsp; On the
heights above the town the prospect expands.&nbsp; To the
south-east the fertile vale of Salop displays its diversified
charms, the Nesscliff Rock, Hawkstone (Lord Hill&rsquo;s
beautiful ancestral residence), and the huge and venerable Wrekin
peering forth in the distance; whilst the high ridges of the
Longmynd and Stiperstones form an uninterrupted chain along the
Welsh border, with the bold and abrupt acclivities of
Cefn-y-Castell and Moel-y-Golfa; and the Breidden, crowned with
Rodney&rsquo;s Pillar, completes the great natural
panorama.&nbsp; Towards the east the Macclesfield hills, dividing
Cheshire from Derbyshire, appear.&nbsp; The view on the Welsh
side is equally impressive, and may well be called &ldquo;the
paradise of Cambria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fullest topographical description of ancient Oswestry that
we have discovered is that of Harrison, who wrote in 1564.&nbsp;
He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oswester is eighteen miles from
Shrewsburie, and containeth a mile within the walls.&nbsp; It
hath in like sort foure suburbs or great streets, of which one is
called Stratlan, another Wuliho, the third Beterich, wherein are
one hundred and forty barns, standing in a row, belonging to the
citizens or burgesses, and the fourth named the Black
Gate-street, in which are thirtie barns maintained for corne and
haie.&nbsp; There is also a brooke running thorough the town by
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the
crosse, coming from Simon&rsquo;s well, a bowshot without the
wall, and going under the same, between Thorow-gate and New-gate,
running under the Black-gate.&nbsp; There is another, over whose
course the Baderikes or Baderich-gate standeth, and therefore
called Baderich brooke; the third passeth by Willi-gate or
New-gate, and these all fall, together with the Crosse brooke, a
mile lower by south, into the Mordaunt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leland, the historian, who briefly sojourned in the town in
the reign of Henry VIII., informs us that the northern part, or
Beatrice-street, at that period contained &ldquo;many barns for
corn and hay, to the number of vii score several barns;&rdquo;
the eastern, or Black-gate, &ldquo;xxx barns for corn, with other
houses &rsquo;longing to the townesmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
writer adds, &ldquo;There be within the town iii most notable
streates, the Cross-streate, the Bayly-streate, and
New-gate-streate.&nbsp; The houses withyn the town be of timbre,
and slated.&nbsp; There is a castell, sette on a mont be
likelihood made by hand; and ditched by south-west, betwixt
Beatrise-gate and Willow-gate, to the which the wall
comith.&nbsp; There be no towers in the waulles besides the
gates.&nbsp; The town is dicked about, and brokettes ren ynto
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Camden describes Oswestry in his day as &ldquo;a
place of good traffic, inclosed with a wall and ditch, and
fortified with a castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pennant&rsquo;s brief
description brings us nearer to the present time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oswestry,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;stands just in
Shropshire, on the very border of the British frontier.&nbsp; It
is 17&frac12; miles from Shrewsbury, 11 from Llangollen, and
179&frac12; from London.&nbsp; The country for several miles
round is delightfully varied with hills, vales, wood, and water,
and abounds in rich scenery.&nbsp; The prospect on the Montgomery
side is terminated abruptly by the august ridge of the prominent
mountains of Breiddyn.&nbsp; It is upon higher ground than any
other town in Shropshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Walls referred to by these writers were erected, as we
have already stated, by Edward I. (probably under the
superintendance of his celebrated architect Elreton, who built
both <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Conway and Caernarvon castles), that he might secure
Oswestry as a key to his intended conquest of Wales, and render
it less liable to the plundering incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp;
These walls were about a mile in circumference, with a
skilfully-made intrenchment on the outside, which could be filled
with water from the springs in the vicinity.&nbsp; Some remains
of this ancient fortification may still be traced, and part of
its boundary-line is designated, up to the present time, as
&ldquo;the Walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were four Gates, the only inlets into the town, and they
stood as strong fortresses in times of disquietude and
danger.&nbsp; As the town advanced in trade and commerce the
Gates became exceedingly inconvenient for the passage of
carriages and merchandize, and in 1766, the Black-Gate was taken
down by consent of Earl Powis, the lord of the manor.&nbsp;
Rylance assures us that &ldquo;Black-Gate was demolished in
consequence of its having become so low in the arch, that loads
could scarce go under, having been rendered so by several
pavements being put one over the other to repair the street, and
make a vent for the water, which made the passage through it
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<a href="images/p93b.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"The New Gate"
title=
"The New Gate"
 src="images/p93s.jpg" />
</a>The convenience rendered to the town by the removal of the
Black-Gate induced the Corporation to obtain the consent of the
lord of the manor to the removal of the three other Gates.&nbsp;
In 1782 an arrangement was accordingly made for their demolition,
and the materials were used in the erection of the borough
prison.&nbsp; The New-Gate was erected in the reign of Edward
II., and was used as a prison and guard-room <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>for the
soldiers.&nbsp; Over the New-Gate (as is seen in our engraving)
was the figure of a horse in full speed, with an oaken bough in
his mouth.&nbsp; Pennant remarks, &ldquo;There is a conjecture,
but I will not pretend to say how well warranted, that it alluded
to the generous breed of horses which Powys-land (of which this
was part) was famous for, derived from some fine Spanish
stallions introduced by Robert de Belesme, Earl of
Shrewsbury.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Beatrice Gate is said to have been named in compliment to
Beatrice, the Queen of Henry IV., and in all probability was
built in that king&rsquo;s reign, as his sojourn in this
district, during his long onslaughts upon the Welsh, connected
him much with the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The gate was a handsome
building, with a guard-house on each side, and over it the arms
of the Fitz-Alans (a lion rampant).&nbsp; It is said to have been
built by Thomas, Earl of Arundel.</p>
<p>Willow-Gate, or Wallia-Gate, derived its name from the road,
in which the gate was situate, leading directly into Wales.</p>
<p>The borough has now assumed, from a number of improvements
made in it, a highly-respectable appearance.&nbsp; Church-Street
may vie, in neatness and public accommodation, with the leading
thoroughfare of any similarly-sized town in the kingdom.&nbsp;
Willow-Street is an active business thoroughfare, the two Banks
and the Post-Office being situated there; Beatrice Street is the
only thoroughfare to the Railway Station, and is therefore, with
Leg-Street, the chief street of traffic.&nbsp; Bailey-Street,
principally confined to shops, is a leading <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>approach to
the Powys Market, Guildhall, and public offices; whilst Upper
Brook-Street is a pleasant location, and will doubtless soon
become a favourite site for villa residences; at least, its
beautiful situation, and the fine healthy country to which it is
proximate, entitle it to such a distinction, Salop Road is on the
march of improvement, and some good modern houses are erected in
it; but yet its dwellings are irregular in size and appearance,
and some time may elapse before it exhibits much of harmony or
attraction, as a leading thoroughfare, unless the projected
railway extension through the town gives, as may reasonably be
expected, a stimulus to house-building in this district.&nbsp;
The innovating hand of modern improvement has not hitherto
effected much change in the central and more dense portions of
the town.&nbsp; Let us &ldquo;wait a little longer,&rdquo; and
the unsightly dwellings deemed palaces by our forefathers, but
which, compared with modern domestic houses, are little better
than huts or hovels, will give place to habitations worthy of
this age, so properly distinguished for its sanatory regulations
and general progress.&nbsp; Such ancient and dilapidated
buildings are mere figments of days gone past, and atone not, by
their pictorial beauty, for their ruined and desolate
condition.&nbsp; The flagging of the leading public streets,
recently determined upon, and which has been partly carried into
effect, will be one of the greatest improvements already adopted
in the borough.&nbsp; The principal thoroughfares in the entire
town will speedily be flagged in the same style, so that in a
short time the inhabitants, ladies especially, will be able to
perambulate the streets, and amuse themselves
&ldquo;a-shopping,&rdquo; without paying for it the hard penalty
of walking in their fashionable boots or slippers over a flinty
pavement.&nbsp; This improvement is being effected from the funds
of a voluntary subscription, to which a large number of the
professional gentry and trading classes have liberally
subscribed.&nbsp; The various roads leading from the town are
wide and well-constructed, and are generally kept in a good
travelling condition.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>The
town is lighted with gas, and has been so for many years
past.&nbsp; The honour of introducing gas-light into Oswestry is
due to Mr. Robert Roberts, civil engineer, a man of much talent
in his profession, and of singular perseverance and
industry.&nbsp; The origin of lighting the town with gas may be
told in a few words.&nbsp; In the year 1819 Mr. Charles Stanton,
at that time Manager of the Oswestry Theatre, which had been
recently built, entered into an arrangement with Mr. Roberts to
light the Theatre during the season.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts had been
hitherto experimenting on a small scale, and was not fully
prepared to enter upon so important a piece of work as
illuminating the Theatre.&nbsp; His persevering habits prevailed,
and he agreed with Mr. Stanton that the Theatre should be lighted
on a certain evening.&nbsp; To introduce gas into a large public
building was deemed an event of no common magnitude in those
days.&nbsp; The appointed evening, in September 1819, at length
arrived, and Mr. Roberts succeeded in lighting the Theatre with a
brilliant gas, which astonished all beholders.&nbsp; The
performances on that evening were for the benefit of Miss
Stanton, the Manager&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; Some tradesmen in
the town quickly availed themselves of this new light; others
followed in the wake; and in the winter season of 1821, the
leading streets of the town were for the first time illuminated
with gas.&nbsp; Places of religious worship soon afterwards
adopted gas.&nbsp; The Welsh Methodist Chapel, in Willow-Street,
first used it; the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, Salop-Road,
followed; and the Old Parish Church, then and still under the
vicarage of the Rev. Thomas Salwey, was afterwards lighted, forty
burners being introduced, including lights at the entrance
doors.&nbsp; The other places of religious worship quickly
followed the example; and in a very few years gas became the
universal light in all public places, private houses, and
commercial and trading establishments.&nbsp; In 1821 the public,
or street-lamps, were only 10 in number; there were 123 private
lights; and one chapel lighted with five lights.&nbsp; In 1854
there were&mdash;private lights, 925; public <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>lamps, 66;
Church and Chapel lights, 112.&nbsp; The lighting of the borough
has been much improved since gas was first introduced here.&nbsp;
It is still under the superintendence of Mr. Roberts, who, now an
octogenarian, is of hale health, and of as active and bustling
habits as he was in the days of his youth.</p>
<p>Oswestry is a market-town, and the chief market is held every
Wednesday.&nbsp; It is abundantly supplied from the surrounding
highly-cultivated agricultural country, and the articles brought
for sale are generally of the very best quality.&nbsp; Welsh
mutton, poultry, and fruits of rare delicacy are among the choice
morsels which the exquisite <i>gourmand</i> may ever find, in
their due season, in the Oswestry market.&nbsp; Apples and pears,
produced in the vicinity, and offered for sale here, might
successfully vie with the best of those fruits grown in Guernsey,
Jersey, or the sunny orchards of Kent.&nbsp; There is a small
market held on the Saturday, principally for the accommodation of
the numerous labouring classes employed in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Twelve <span class="smcap">Fairs</span> are also held in the
town, all of which are conducted with great spirit, and attended
by a large class of buyers and sellers.&nbsp; A Fair is held on
the first Wednesday in every month.</p>
<h3>Public Establishments and Institutions.</h3>
<p>Imagine a party of strangers visiting Oswestry, having heard
much spoken in favour of its neatness and beauty, and the
picturesque scenery by which it is surrounded; and stretch forth
your imagination, gentle reader, by supposing that this party
have been comfortably supplied with viands, and perchance
&ldquo;the cup which cheers, but not inebriates,&rdquo; by mine
host of the Cross Keys or the Wynnstay Arms.&nbsp; Having
discussed these good things, they may perhaps hasten out in quest
of &ldquo;the lions&rdquo; of the place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us away
to the <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Museum!&rdquo; probably exclaims one of the ladies of
the party who is ever in search of the <i>utile</i> as well as
the <i>dulce</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a charming spot,&rdquo;
she perhaps adds, &ldquo;for mineralogical and geological
curiosities.&nbsp; The country, we are told, abounds in
productive lead, copper, and coal mines.&nbsp; We shall surely
collect much useful information in this practical and exploratory
district, and return home wiser than when we came.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bravissimo!&rdquo; may be the cry and echo of most of the
party, &ldquo;Miss Aimwell is ever zealous in good works, and
to-day she is bent upon providing for us no common store of
rational pleasure and information.&nbsp; Let us hasten to the
Museum, therefore, at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; The party, we
suppose&mdash;for it is merely a fancy sketch&mdash;hie away
towards the imaginary Museum, full of glee, anticipating the
pleasure of exchanging compliments with the Curator, and one
Director at least, and of inspecting a carefully-selected
collection of natural curiosities, comprising, of course,
attractive productions in the mineral world; specimens in
ornithology; some of the many wonders and &ldquo;gems of purest
ray serene,&rdquo; snatched from the deep caverns of the ocean;
rare marbles and pebbles chiselled out of rocks and caves,
mountains and dells; botanical rarities, and floral,
horticultural, native and exotic products; with gatherings from
the realms of art, science, fancy, and literature.&nbsp; Do the
imaginary party discover the Museum, or a Public Library, or any
Institution whatever, in which Lord Bacon&rsquo;s axiom is
illustrated, that &ldquo;knowledge is power?&rdquo;&nbsp; No such
thing is in existence.&nbsp; The fancied party&mdash;or fanciful
party, as some people would denominate them&mdash;have been in
search of &ldquo;the baseless fabric of a vision.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Like Puff, in Sheridan&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Critic</i>,&rdquo; they
might say, with a slight interpolation,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Museum we cannot see,<br />
Because it&rsquo;s not in sight!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning from the gay to the grave, we reiterate, there is no
Museum in the town; nor even a Public Library, on a scale worthy
of so respectable a community.&nbsp; We wish it were <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>otherwise;
and the day is not far off, we trust, when the reproach will be
wiped away, and Oswestry shall shew an example in this respect
deserving of all praise.</p>
<h3>THE POST OFFICE</h3>
<p>Is situated in Willow-Street.&nbsp; Post-Mistress, Miss Sarah
Babington, who has held her appointment since May, 1831.&nbsp;
The Post Office was removed from Church-Street to Willow-Street,
in October, 1839.</p>

<h3>THE BANKS.</h3>
<p>There are two Banks in the town.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Old Bank</span>, under the firm of &ldquo;Croxon,
Jones, Longueville, and Co.,&rdquo; is situated in Willow-Street,
and has been established for upwards of seventy years.&nbsp; The
original co-partners were Messrs. Gibbons, Croxon, and
Sheppard.&nbsp; The present co-partners are Thomas Longueville
Longueville, Esq., John Croxon, Esq., Richard Jones Croxon, Esq.,
and James Thomas Jones, Esq., who is also Acting Manager.&nbsp;
Mr. Jones&rsquo;s father (Mr. Charles Thomas Jones) likewise
discharged the duties of Manager of this Bank for the long period
of thirty-five years.&nbsp; In such capacity, also in that of
Chief Magistrate, and as a warm friend to every useful
institution in the borough, he earned the grateful esteem of his
fellow-townsmen.&nbsp; This Bank issues &pound;5 notes, payable
here or in London: issue limited by law to &pound;18,470.&nbsp;
Circulation, on an average of the last five years,
&pound;10,180.&mdash;Draw on Masterman and Co., Nicholas Lane,
London.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">North and South Wales Bank</span>,
also situated in Willow-Street, is a Branch to the Bank bearing
that title, established April, 1836, in Liverpool.&nbsp; The
Oswestry Branch was opened June, 1836.&nbsp; There are fifteen
Branches of the North and South Wales Bank established in the
Principality and the Borders.&nbsp; Manager:&mdash;Mr. F.
Roberts, appointed September, 1845.&mdash;Draw on the London and
Westminster Bank.</p>
<h4>THE SAVINGS&rsquo; BANK,</h4>
<p>On the Bailey Head, was established in 1818; and at the
present time it is in a state of great prosperity, showing the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>careful and
economic habits of a large portion of the labouring classes in
this thriving district.&nbsp; From the annual account of the
Trustees of the Bank, ending 20th November, 1854, it appears,
that the balance in favour of the Depositors amounted to
&pound;69,975 18s. 11d.&nbsp; The number of Depositors whose
respective balances, including interest, did not exceed &pound;1
each, was 77; of those &pound;1, and not exceeding &pound;5, 303;
ditto above &pound;5, and not exceeding &pound;10, 270; ditto
above &pound;10, and not exceeding &pound;15, 217; ditto above
&pound;15, and not exceeding &pound;20, 146; ditto above
&pound;20, and not exceeding &pound;30, 253; ditto above
&pound;30, and not exceeding &pound;40, 194; ditto above
&pound;40, and not exceeding &pound;50, 113; ditto above
&pound;50, and not exceeding &pound;75, 188; ditto above
&pound;75, and not exceeding &pound;100, 89; ditto above
&pound;100, and not exceeding &pound;125, 49; ditto above
&pound;125, and not exceeding &pound;150, 23; ditto above
&pound;150, and not exceeding &pound;200, 41; ditto exceeding
&pound;200, 2.&nbsp; The total number of Depositors was 1965;
Charitable Societies, 30; and Friendly Societies, 31.&nbsp; The
total number of accounts was 2026.&nbsp; The affairs of the Bank
are conducted by ten Trustees and fourteen Managers.</p>

<h3>THE MARKETS.</h3>
<p>Until very recently the town of Oswestry had not provided any
market-sites worthy of the name.&nbsp; As the town, however,
advanced in population and trading pursuits, and agriculture and
farming in general progressed in the neighbourhood, the want of
new and convenient public markets began to <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>be
seriously felt, and most of the inhabitants, and gentlemen
connected with the neighbourhood, were disposed to contribute
towards the completion of such desirable improvements.&nbsp; A
very liberal spirit was manifested in favour of so excellent a
design; a public subscription was set on foot; and at length the
sum of &pound;3202 was raised, which was laid out towards
erecting the Cross Market, as that was considered to be the most
desirable to commence upon.&nbsp; But this sum being found
insufficient to cover the cost even of this Market, it was agreed
by the Town Council to apply to Parliament for an Act, empowering
them to effect further Market Improvements in the borough, and to
raise &pound;5000 for that purpose.&nbsp; Accordingly a Bill was
presented to Parliament, in 1848, entitled &ldquo;The Oswestry
Markets and Fairs Bill,&rdquo; and in February of that year Mr.
Fowler, Surveying Officer of the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests, attended at Oswestry, to hear evidence upon the proposed
markets.&nbsp; R. J. Croxon, Esq., Town-Clerk, appeared for the
promoters, and having pointed out, in a long address, the evils
arising from holding the Fairs and Markets in the public streets,
called several witnesses in support of his statement.&nbsp; Mr.
Fowler reported favourably of the objects of the promoters; and
in the same Session of Parliament the Act received the royal
assent.&nbsp; The measure being so far successful, no time was
lost in carrying out this creditable project; and on June 6th,
1849, the <span class="smcap">Cross Market</span>, for the sale
of butter, eggs, poultry, fruit and vegetables, was opened.&nbsp;
Part of the market is also used for the sale of butchers&rsquo;
meat.&nbsp; The Powis <span class="smcap">Market-Hall</span>,
forming one side of the Bailey Square, was opened on the same
day.&nbsp; The chief part of the buildings of which the Powis
Market is composed, as well as the site on which the new portion
of the Market stands, was presented to the town by the late Earl
of Powis, Lord of the Manor and Lordship of Oswestry, his
Lordship merely stipulating that he and his successors should
have the use of the new Guildhall when the same was wanted for
holding the Manor Courts.&nbsp; The site on which <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the Cross
Market was built, being in the centre of the town, had been
covered with shops and dwellings, all of which were purchased at
a cost of upwards of &pound;2,700.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Penson was
the architect employed on this Market, and Messrs. Griffith and
William Morris contracted for its erection.&nbsp; The market is
spacious and convenient, is covered in, and has three entrances,
the main one being from the Cross.&nbsp; The Powis Market-Hall,
in which accommodation is given to farmers and general dealers in
cheese, butter, and grain, is a plain stone-fronted edifice, with
a high clock turret.&nbsp; The front part of the building was
formerly used as the Guild-Hall, at the back of which new
buildings have been erected, in brick, and partly covered with
glass.&nbsp; This market has been found to be exceedingly
convenient, especially in the winter season; and the
accommodation thus rendered to buyers and sellers has contributed
so much to increase their number, that a considerable extension
to the market is contemplated.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Cattle Market</span> comprises an extensive piece
of ground, situated between Church-Street and Croxon&rsquo;s
Square, which was purchased from Mr. George Withers Edwards, at a
cost of &pound;1050.&nbsp; It is exceedingly well attended, and
fully justifies the expectations of all parties engaged in its
formation.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Horse Market</span> is
situated at the back of the Powis Market.&nbsp; The site on which
it is held, comprising 4256 square yards, was purchased for
&pound;279.&nbsp; Both of these markets were opened on Wednesday,
4th July, 1849.&mdash;Mr. George Cooper is Treasurer of the
Markets; and Mr. John Donald Superintendent.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Most of the leading gentlemen of the town had taken an active
interest in the formation of the new markets, and no one was more
zealously engaged in promoting them than Peploe Cartwright, Esq.,
to whom, after the completion of these public improvements, a
service of plate, consisting of a silver salver, tureen, and four
corner dishes, was presented on behalf of the Corporation and a
numerous body of the inhabitants of <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the town and neighbourhood, as a
testimony of their sense of his many &ldquo;public services in
forwarding the improvements of the town, and in particular for
his able, zealous, and untiring exertions in promoting the
establishment of the fairs and market
accommodations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The presentation of the plate took
place December 26th, 1850, in the Powis Market-Hall, in the
presence of a numerous assembly.&nbsp; The Recorder of the
borough, John Robert Kenyon, Esq., presented the plate, in an
appropriate and eloquent speech; and Mr. Cartwright responded
with ability and feeling.&nbsp; On the same day, as a further
testimonial to Mr. Cartwright, a public dinner was given to him,
at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel, on which occasion the festive
enthusiasm which distinguishes the Salopian gentry was more than
ordinarily displayed.&nbsp; The entire proceedings of the day
passed off with the utmost satisfaction.</p>
<h3>THE GAS-WORKS</h3>
<p>Were erected in 1842, at the sole expense of Mr. Robert
Roberts, the proprietor, on a piece of land situated near
Gallows-tree Bank turnpike gate, the original works in
Willow-Street having long before been found too small and
inconvenient to meet the increasing requirements of the
town.&nbsp; The new works were built on an extended scale, and
comprise a retort-house, purifying house, with a large tank and
gasometer.&nbsp; The apparatus is of the usual character,
including condenser, purifier, scrub, with fire-clay retorts,
hydraulic main, &amp;c.&nbsp; The chimney is square, and spiral
in form, tapering to the top, and forms an object of interest on
the approach to the town from Shrewsbury.</p>
<h3>THE THEATRE</h3>
<p>Is a small neat building in Willow-Street, but is not often
occupied.&nbsp; It is the property of William Ormsby Gore, Esq.,
who, when he built it, doubtless considered he was providing
means of rational entertainment for the inhabitants.&nbsp; But
Melpomene and Thalia have lost their charms in this district; <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>and the
immortal works of Shakspeare, Jonson, Fletcher, Massinger,
Colman, Sheridan, Knowles, Bulwer, and others, are doomed to shed
their fragrance only in the library or study.&nbsp; Thirty years
ago the acted drama was deemed a genial and instructive
amusement, and the boxes, pit, and gallery of Oswestry Theatre
were frequently crowded with fashionable and attentive
audiences.&nbsp; About the period to which we refer the Theatre
was under the careful and clever management of Mr. Charles
Stanton, who, with his family, &ldquo;gained golden
opinions,&rdquo; and a more than decent competence, by his
histrionic labours.&nbsp; During the time he presided over the
Thespian realm, he succeeded in attaching to his <i>corps
theatrique</i> many ladies and gentlemen of talent and high
principle, who afterwards figured with advantage in more extended
spheres of their profession; and whilst he held the reins of
government, he deserved and received the good opinion of his
supporters.&nbsp; After having thus briefly adverted to
theatricals in Oswestry, it will not be inappropriate to mention,
that on no occasion, perhaps, in the history of provincial
dramatic performances, were more brilliant and exhilarating
scenes displayed than in 1822, when a number of ladies and
gentlemen, most of them residents of the town or neighbourhood,
kindly volunteered their services as <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> in a series of dramatic productions.&nbsp;
Three performances were determined upon, that a fund might be
raised for establishing in the town a Public Library.&nbsp; The
first took place February 15th, when the comedy of
&ldquo;<i>Speed the Plough</i>,&rdquo; and the afterpiece of
&ldquo;<i>The Review</i>,&rdquo; were presented.&nbsp; An
original Prologue, from the pen of William Ormsby Gore, Esq., was
spoken by the characters.&nbsp; The receipts of the night were
&pound;76 12s. 6d.&nbsp; On the evening of May 23rd, in the same
year, Colman&rsquo;s comedy of &ldquo;<i>The Heir at
Law</i>,&rdquo; and the afterpiece of &ldquo;<i>The
Review</i>,&rdquo; were performed.&nbsp; Mr. Alderman Salisbury,
a hale octogenarian, spoke a Prologue to the play, attributed to
Garrick.&nbsp; Colman&rsquo;s Epilogue was spoken by the
characters.&nbsp; The receipts on this occasion were
&pound;47.&nbsp; The third performance, <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>May 25th,
consisted of &ldquo;<i>Speed the Plough</i>,&rdquo; and the
afterpiece of &ldquo;<i>High Life below Stairs</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Receipts &pound;24.&nbsp; The late J. F. M. Dovaston, Esq., who
had taken much interest in these performances, wrote a Prologue
to &ldquo;<i>The Heir at Law</i>,&rdquo; and it was intended that
he should enact the part of Lord Duberly, and deliver his own
witty effusion.&nbsp; Some differences, however, arose, and he
did not therefore take any part in the performances.&nbsp;
Although the total receipts amounted to the handsome sum of
&pound;147 12s. 6d., yet the expense of scenery, &amp;c.,
exhausted nearly all the fund, and the original design, of
establishing a Public Library, failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Dovaston&rsquo;s Prologue is given in his volume of Poems,
published in 1825.&nbsp; It forms part of the literary history of
Oswestry, and we therefore make no apology for transferring it to
our pages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;PROLOGUE,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is worthy of notice also, that in the same year in which
the performances were given in behalf of a Public Library, the
celebrated actor, distinguished as &ldquo;The Young
Roscius,&rdquo; Mr. William Henry West Betty, appeared on the
Oswestry Stage, and played several of his popular
characters.&nbsp; Mr. Betty soon afterwards retired from public
life; and for many years past has been residing in London, having
earned a handsome fortune, enjoying his <i>otium cum
dignitate</i>.&nbsp; He was a native of Shrewsbury, and in right
of his mother was heir to the extensive estate of Hopton Wafers,
in Shropshire.</p>
<h3>THE HOTELS.</h3>
<p>The principal Hotels in the town are, the Cross Keys, the
Wynnstay Arms, the Queen&rsquo;s Head, and Osburn&rsquo;s
Commercial.&nbsp; All these Hotels are well-conducted, and are
much frequented by commercial travellers, private families, and
tourists through the Principality and Border Lands.</p>
<h3>Educational Institutions.</h3>
<h4>THE FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p106b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Free Grammar School"
title=
"The Free Grammar School"
 src="images/p106s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This ancient and valuable institution was founded and endowed
in the reign of Henry IV., between 1399 and 1413, by Mr. David
Holbetche, &ldquo;a lawyer, steward of the towne and
lordship,&rdquo; and who in the same reign was &ldquo;made a
denizen or free citizen of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; The munificent
founder granted, for the maintenance of a schoolmaster, and the
reparation of the school-house, certain lands in Sweeney,
Treflach, Maesbury, and Crickheath, in addition to a house on the
south-west side of the Parish Church.&nbsp; By an inquisition
under a Commission of charitable uses, taken at Oswestry, 17th
September, 1634, it was found that &ldquo;how the said lands were
granted, or to whom, or by whom, they were to be let, <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>was not
known, but that the bailiffs of the town of Oswestry had, for the
most part, jointly let the same:&rdquo; and it was further found,
&ldquo;that upon the granting of certain leases
therein-mentioned, certain sums had been paid to the bailiffs, or
to their use, as a gratuity for making such leases; and that they
had cut timber upon the said estates which they had disposed of
for their own use.&rdquo;&nbsp; In April, 1635, the Commissioners
made a decree, stating &ldquo;that they had not found that the
bailiffs of Oswestry were trusted by the founder in ordering and
disposing of the said school and school-lands, but that they had
done the same without any just authority; and that if they had
been trusted therein, they had manifestly abused the trust, in
making leases at an under-value, and for secret rewards for
themselves, and in committing great waste upon the timber-trees
growing upon the said premises; the said Commissioners decreed,
that the bailiffs of the said town should be for ever discharged
and excluded from any trust, or intermeddling with the said
school and school-lands, or from anything which should concern
the same, otherwise than was thereafter limited; that the
nomination and placing of the schoolmaster should be left to the
bishop of the diocese according to the law; that the schoolmaster
for the time being should let the premises in possession, and not
in reversion, for the term of seven years, at the yearly rents
mentioned in a particular of the lands referred to in the
inquisition, or more, and so as the consent of the bishop and
chancellor of the said diocese, and of the bailiffs of the said
town, or any two of them, whereof the bishop should be one,
should be first had in writing, for the making of such leases;
that neither the master nor any of the tenants should cut or lop
any timber-trees growing upon the premises without the like
consent; that the then schoolmaster should, within one year, make
a true terrier of all the school-lands and tenements, whereof one
part should be delivered to the bishop, to be kept in his
registrar&rsquo;s office, and the other to be delivered to the
bailiffs, to be entered in the town-book.&nbsp; And the said
Commissioners <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>further ordered, that the schoolmaster should always
have an usher, and allow him &pound;10 a-year, and so much more
out of the improved rents, as the said bishop for the time being
should think fit; so that the whole stipend of the usher should
not exceed &pound;15; and that the schoolmaster for the time
being, should keep the school-house in repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A terrier of the school-lands was accordingly taken, and the
report was as follows:&mdash;<i>Crickheath</i>, 24a. 1r. 37p.;
<i>Treflach</i>, 20a. 1r. 5p.; <i>Sweeney</i>, 74a. 0r. 10p.;
<i>Maesbury</i>, 12a. 0r. 29p.&nbsp; The lands in Treflach
mentioned in the terrier had been held for many years at the
ancient rents, without any variation; and the Rev. James Donne,
D.D. (the former master), brought actions of ejectment against
the late Lazarus Venables, Esq., and Mrs. Hilditch, who held the
lands, and insisted upon their right to hold them, paying the
accustomed rents.&nbsp; Upon the trial of these actions verdicts
were given in favour of Dr. Donne, and the lands being very much
dispersed and intermixed with those belonging to the defendants,
the judge recommended that lands equal in value, and lying
together, should be given up to the plaintiff, instead of the
identical lands which were the subject of the suits.&nbsp; This
recommendation was cordially adopted by all parties concerned,
and further litigation was therefore avoided.</p>
<p>Dr. Donne, through whose exertions these valuable properties
were recovered for Oswestry School, may justly be looked upon as
its second Founder.&nbsp; He raised the character of the School
from comparative obscurity to being second to none of the Grammar
Schools of England.&nbsp; His memory is held in affectionate
remembrance by his pupils, who, to testify their feelings, raised
a handsome Memorial in Oswestry Parish Church.&nbsp; The
inscription on this Monument speaks deservedly of a revered
Master, and does credit to the elegant scholarship and
affectionate feelings of the distinguished Pupil who composed
it.</p>
<p>Further advantageous exchanges of land have taken place <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>during the
time of the present Master, which have resulted in attaching some
of the most valuable land in the Liberties of Oswestry and
Township of Weston to Oswestry School.</p>
<p>The Rents of the property accruing to the benefit of the
School, including a payment of &pound;1 12s. 0d. from the
receiver of the Crown Rents, in respect of a sum of &pound;2
charged on the land revenues, amount to &pound;271 10s. 2d.&nbsp;
Some land around the School-House is not included in this
statement, so that the Endowment of the School may be considered
to amount to &pound;300 per annum.</p>
<p>In 1776 the late Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart., gave a piece of land,
called <i>Cae Groes</i>, comprising nearly eight acres, upon
which the present School-House was erected, charged with a rent
of &pound;12 per annum, to the heirs of Sir W. W. Wynn; and the
sum of &pound;779 4s. 8d. was subsequently subscribed towards
completing the structure, the balance of expenses having been
borne by Dr. Donne.</p>
<p>The School is open to all boys born in the parish of Oswestry,
for instruction in English, Latin, and Greek; but it is expected
that they should be able to read before they are admitted.&nbsp;
For the before-mentioned studies no payment is demanded from the
boys on the Foundation, except 12s. 6d. for entrance, and 2s.
a-year for fire-money.&nbsp; The present Master is the Rev.
Stephen Donne, A.M., who has filled the office since his
appointment in 1833 with singular merit and success, and who has
had the good fortune, during his connexion with the School, to
acquire the esteem and confidence of his pupils, and the warm
approval and regard of their parents and guardians.</p>
<p>The course of instruction in the School is Classical and
Mathematical, embracing strict attention to Religious knowledge,
with History and Geography, both Ancient and Modern; and whilst
pupils are prepared for the Universities, and Addiscombe,
Woolwich, and Sandhurst, boys who have in view the Profession of
the Law or a Commercial life, in addition to their other studies,
are carefully trained in Writing, <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>Arithmetic, and Book-keeping.&nbsp;
The Head Master receives Boarders into his House, who are treated
in a liberal and gentlemanly spirit.&nbsp; Several Pupils from
this School have, during the time of the late and present Master,
highly distinguished themselves at Cambridge, Oxford, Dublin,
Addiscombe, and Woolwich.</p>
<p>The late Rev. James Donne, D.D., retired from the School in
1833, and died at Llanyblodwel Vicarage (which he had re-built),
January 23rd, 1844.</p>
<p>The early Masters of the School we are unable to
discover.&nbsp; Our list of appointments commences with the year
1537:&mdash;</p>

<h4>NATIONAL SCHOOLS.</h4>
<p>In the work of benevolence the borough of Oswestry has never
acted with a niggardly hand.&nbsp; When the necessity of national
education first engaged the sympathies of the community at large,
Oswestry took a distinguished part in the good work, and
liberally provided education for the children of the poor, who,
until that period, had had none to help them.&nbsp; So early as
the commencement of the last century a Charity School was
established for the benefit of forty children, of whom twenty
were clothed, and all taught by a mistress to read and
spell.&nbsp; When the boys were made perfect in the reading of
certain elementary books, they were transferred to a master; and
the girls were fully instructed, besides reading and spelling, in
spinning, knitting, and sewing.&nbsp; It is stated on one of the
tables of benefactions in the Parish Church, that in 1713 Mr.
Thomas Owen, Vicar of Oswestry, left the interest of &pound;20
for the use of this Charity School; and that in 1716 the Rev.
Daniel Poole, chief Schoolmaster of the town, left the interest
of &pound;20 for the like use.&nbsp; In a minute of vestry, dated
July 5th, 1737, it is stated that &pound;32 was laid out on the
Poor-house in Church-Street, which sum, it is added, was paid out
of the legacies of the Rev. T. Owen and the Rev. D. Poole.&nbsp;
In December, in the same year, it was ordered at a vestry, that
in lieu of the money laid out as mentioned in the preceding
minute, forty shillings should be paid yearly toward maintaining
the Charity School in the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; It does not
appear what school was intended, or how long the payment was
continued.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>The
friends of education in Oswestry, still anxious for the
well-being of the rising generation, united together in the year
1810 to carry out their benevolent intentions.&nbsp; In July of
that year it was agreed, that the Guildhall should be
appropriated for the reception of boys, and the school-room
situated in the church-yard for the reception of girls, until
rooms at the Bailey-Head should be properly fitted up for their
instruction.&nbsp; A public notice was afterwards issued,
announcing &ldquo;That the Public Charity School, belonging to
the town and parish of Oswestry, is now open for the instruction
of boys of the age of five years and upwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
November following, the boys&rsquo; school was removed to the
chapel of the House of Industry, the School Committee considering
that such change would afford an opportunity to the children of
parents residing in the country to attend the school.&nbsp; This
plan partly failed, and soon afterwards convenient school-rooms,
for boys and girls, were fitted up at the Bailey-Head, from plans
by Mr. T. Jones, Architect.&nbsp; These schools were supported by
general subscription and occasional aid from the National
Society.&nbsp; At length it was deemed necessary to provide more
spacious and convenient school-rooms, for the furtherance of the
great <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>object of education, and arrangements were made for
accomplishing so important a design.&nbsp; A public subscription
was entered into, and this was aided by grants of &pound;338 from
the Committee of Council on Education; &pound;200 from the
National Society; and a contribution of &pound;700 from the funds
of the Oswestry Church Sunday School.&nbsp; The present beautiful
building was accordingly erected under the Welsh Walls,
sufficient accommodation being rendered for an Infant
School.&nbsp; The structure was designed by Mr. Penson, and
raised by Mr. J. Vaughan, Builder.&nbsp; As a tribute of respect
to the memory of the late Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart., the building was
commenced on the 22nd of May, 1841, when his son, the present
worthy possessor of Wynnstay, attained his majority.&nbsp; The
sole control of the School is vested by the trust-deed in the
Vicar of the parish for the time being.&nbsp; The number of
children at present educated in the Schools is&mdash;Boys, 78;
Girls, 64; Infants, 57.&mdash;Master, Mr. S. S. Lees; Mistresses,
Miss Whitfield and Miss Pierce.</p>

</a></p>
<h4>THE PARISH CHURCH SUNDAY SCHOOL</h4>
<p>Was established in 1831.&nbsp; A zealous interest is taken in
its prosperity by the Clergy and many persons of wealth and
influence in the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; The average
attendance at present is 280 Scholars; Teachers from 30 to
35.</p>
<h4>THE BRITISH SCHOOLS</h4>
<p>Were erected in 1841, at a cost, including the site, of about
&pound;800; the builder being Mr. James Vaughan.</p>
<p>They are held in trust for &ldquo;the education of children
and adults, or children only, of both sexes, of the labouring,
manufacturing, and other classes, in the town and parish of
Oswestry, and in the several parishes adjoining;&rdquo; such
education to be conducted on the principles of the British and
Foreign School Society.&nbsp; The trust includes permission to
use the premises on week days, prior to and after school hours <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>(i.e.
before 9 a.m. and after 6 p.m.), for &ldquo;such moral, literary,
scientific, or other purposes,&rdquo; as shall be allowed in
manner therein mentioned.&nbsp; The funds for the erection of the
Schools having been subscribed chiefly by members of the
congregation assembling at the Old Chapel, there is a trust
assigning the use of the building on the sabbath to the Sabbath
Schools connected with that place of worship.</p>
<p>The system of education on week days being conducted on the
principles of the British and Foreign School Society, it need
hardly be said that no denominational catechism or dogma is
permitted to be taught; but the Holy Scriptures are in daily
use.</p>
<p>The utility of the institution having become much crippled by
a debt remaining on the building and an accumulation of current
expenses, a special effort was made in the year 1854 to throw off
the incubus.&nbsp; The generous efforts and contributions of
friends in the town and neighbourhood, and others in various
parts of the kingdom, aided by a Bazaar, not only effected the
&ldquo;consummation&rdquo; so &ldquo;devoutly to be
wished,&rdquo; but also realized a fund applicable to the
substantial repair of the building, and a needed supply of school
materials.</p>
<p>The present Master and Mistress are&mdash;Mr. Farmer and Miss
Jones.</p>
<h4>THE YOUNG MEN&rsquo;S INSTITUTE</h4>
<p>Began its course about the year 1838.&nbsp; It was originated
by the then minister of the Old Chapel (the Rev. W. Reeve), and a
few members of his congregation, chiefly young men, who felt the
importance of adopting some means calculated to promote the moral
and intellectual advancement of the young men of the town, and
which should offer to them a refuge and enticement, during the
evening hours, from listlessness on the one hand, and from low
and debasing pleasures on the other.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>The
meetings were for some time held in the vestry of the Old
Chapel.&nbsp; When the British School-rooms were erected in the
year 1841 the opportunity was taken of endeavouring to extend the
benefits of the Institute, by transferring its meetings to the
lower school-room.&nbsp; Still it was felt by its friends, that
it was not so used or supported as they desired; but, necessity
having no choice, no attempt was made for several years to change
its location or enlarge its scope.</p>
<p>At the School-room the Institute prospered for a considerable
time, and did much good; but afterwards, from one cause or
another, it drooped, and well nigh sank.&nbsp; Deeming it,
however, too good a thing to die, and thinking it possible that
many influential parties might have withheld their sympathy and
aid, from an idea (erroneous though it was) that the Institution,
from its antecedents and place of meeting, was not entirely
unsectarian and liberal, its friends made a successful effort in
the year 1850 to resuscitate it.&nbsp; The clergy and dissenting
ministers of the town, together with several influential lay
gentlemen, formed a committee, obtained the use of the Guild-Hall
for the meetings, and raised very extended subscriptions.&nbsp;
Many excellent lectures, professional and amateur, were
delivered, and new life seemed for a time to flow in the veins of
the Institute.&nbsp; The Guild-Hall being found inconvenient for
the Library and Reading-room, these were removed to rooms over
the Shop of Mr. Richard Jones, Hatter, at the Cross.</p>
<p>Subsequently, however, the falling-off of the subscriptions,
and, it must be added, the backwardness of the young men
generally to avail themselves of the privileges offered them,
obliged the committee to relinquish these premises, and for more
than a year past there seem to have been no meetings.</p>
<p>It is said that &ldquo;all that&rsquo;s fair must
fade.&rdquo;&nbsp; May we hope that the Young Men&rsquo;s
Institute is only slumbering, and will not die, or, that dying,
it will rise again to a stronger, happier, better life.</p>

117</span>Benevolent Institutions.</h2>
<h3>DISPENSARY AND BATHS.</h3>
<p>The establishment of these two institutions is honourable to
the founders, and, we are glad to observe, of great benefit to
the poor and needy afflicted with disease.&nbsp; The origin of
both is part of the annals of the town, and claims especial
record in our volume.&nbsp; We find that in the year 1828 a
meeting of the leading gentlemen of Oswestry was held, for the
purpose of endeavouring to establish a Dispensary.&nbsp; That
assembly was presided over by William Ormsby Gore, Esq., and the
benevolent institution was at once founded under most liberal
auspices.&nbsp; Donations amounting to one hundred and sixty
guineas were subscribed at the meeting, and a Committee was
appointed, to carry out the objects of the Charity.&nbsp; At the
same time a liberal amount in annual subscriptions was determined
upon, that the new institution should be rendered
permanent.&nbsp; The following parties formed the first
Committee, &amp;c.</p>

and inconvenient for the benevolent objects contemplated, a new
building was suggested, and accordingly, in March, 1852, the
Committee adopted a resolution to the effect, that it was
desirable to erect a Dispensary, with Baths attached to it, for
the accommodation of the public, as well as for the use of the
patients of the institution.&nbsp; To carry out this excellent
design a handsome subscription was entered into, amounting to
between seven and eight hundred pounds; to which was added, from
the accumulated fund of the Dispensary, the sum of five hundred
pounds.&nbsp; The present Dispensary and Baths were immediately
erected from a design by R. Kyrke Penson, Esq., on ground near
the site of the former Dispensary.&nbsp; The building is roomy
and convenient, containing handsome and suitable rooms for the
Dispensary, with the addition of Warm and Cold Baths, Shower
Baths, a Vapour Bath, and Plunge Baths.</p>

<p>The Trustees to whom the site for the new Dispensary and Baths
was conveyed are, William Ormsby Gore, Esq., Thomas Lovett, Esq.,
Edmund Wright, Esq., and Thomas Longueville Longueville, Esq.</p>
<p>The proposition for building the Dispensary with the addition
of Baths originated with Edward Williams, Esq., of Lloran House;
and his efficient and zealous efforts were used in promoting the
benevolent design, which was most successfully accomplished in
the end.&nbsp; In the prosperity of so valuable an institution
all classes in the town and populous neighbourhood, who are
blessed with this world&rsquo;s goods, should consider it a
Christian privilege to take a lively interest, by contributing to
its funds, and thus extending its usefulness among the labouring
poor who have few to help them.</p>
<h3>THE HOUSE OF INDUSTRY,</h3>
<p>Situated on elevated ground near the river Morda, on the road
from Oswestry to Welshpool, was erected by virtue of an Act of
Parliament obtained in the year 1790, and opened for the
reception of inmates April 28th, 1791.&nbsp; The first steward
and matron were Mr. Thos. Cooper and Mrs. Cooper, <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>who held
those responsible situations for the long period of nearly thirty
years.&nbsp; Directors were appointed, under the Act, to manage
the affairs of the institution, on behalf of Oswestry town and
parish, and the other parishes also thereby incorporated: namely,
Saint Martins, Selattyn, Whittington, West Felton, Ruyton,
Kinnerley, Knockin, and Llanyblodwel, in the hundred of Oswestry,
and county of Salop; that part of the parish of Llanymynech which
lies in the hundred of Oswestry; the parish of Chirk, in the
county of Denbigh; and the parish of Llansilin, in the counties
of Salop and Denbigh.&nbsp; The Directors held their first
meeting on Monday, August 11th, 1791: Chairman, John Lovett,
Esq., Mayor of Oswestry.&nbsp; The building, of red brick, which
still looks fresh and fair, cost &pound;12,000.&nbsp; It has ever
excited the attention of strangers, on account of its imposing
stateliness of architecture, the exterior presenting, at the
first view, the appearance of a fine old English baronial
residence.&nbsp; Nicholson, in describing it thirty years ago,
says, &ldquo;it is a ridiculously-splendid brick building,
intended, not for a purpose which its exterior seems to prompt,
but for the abode of the indigent and wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1851 a slight sensation was created in the united parishes
of Oswestry by a proposal from Mr. Doyle, Poor-Law Inspector, to
admit six additional parishes into union with the Oswestry
Incorporation.&nbsp; The Poor-Law Board had some time before
claimed a general authority over the Incorporation, to which the
Directors, after a slight resistance, submitted.&nbsp; Public
meetings of the rate-payers of the incorporated parishes were
held, to consider Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s proposal, and one also was
convened in the Old Church, Oswestry, on Saturday, July 21st:
Peploe Cartwright, Esq., in the chair.&nbsp; Mr. Doyle stated
that certain alterations in the House of Industry would have to
be made; and in order to effect these improvements at as small a
cost as possible to the incorporated parishes, he suggested that
six other parishes should be united to the present, the expense
being thus spread over a larger number <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of
rate-payers.&nbsp; The proposal was not favourably entertained,
as such a measure would have involved the immediate dissolution
of the Oswestry Incorporation.&nbsp; A resolution was adopted at
the meeting, &ldquo;That in the absence of proper information and
details, we are at present of opinion that it is not desirable to
dissolve the Oswestry Incorporation.&rdquo;&nbsp; From that time
to the present the Poor-Law Board exercise only a general
authority over the Incorporation, whose powers, as defined by the
Act of Parliament, with the exception just named, remain
intact.</p>
<p>In 1853 various alterations, suggested by the Poor-Law Board,
were made in the House, at an expense of &pound;1500.&nbsp; The
average number of inmates in the Institution is 174.&nbsp; The
number which the House can receive is limited by the Poor-Law
Board to 300.&nbsp; The election of Directors is independent of
the Board; they are nominated by the vestries of the several
parishes, and appointed by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The present officers of the Institution are as
follows:&mdash;The Rev. J. Maude, Chairman; the Rev. E. W. O.
Bridgman, Vice-Chairman; Mr. John Hughes, Clerk to the Directors;
and Mr. R. Richards, Master.&nbsp; Relieving Officers:&mdash;For
the <i>Upper Division</i>, comprising Oswestry Town and Parish,
Llanyblodwel, townships of Llwyntidman and Treprenal, Llansilin,
and Selattyn, Mr. Thomas Davies.&nbsp; For the <i>Lower
Division</i>, consisting of Chirk, Saint Martins, Whittington,
Ruyton, West Felton, Knockin, and Kinnerley, Mr. Joseph
Rogers.</p>
<h3>CHARITABLE DONATIONS TO THE POOR.</h3>
<p>In the present age the good old-fashioned mode of bequeathing
some portion of worldly substance for the education or relief of
the poor is recognized by very few of our wealthier
fellow-countrymen.&nbsp; The usual channels of relief to the poor
and needy&mdash;the Poor-Law Union, the Night Asylum, the Good
Samaritan Society, and other institutions of like class&mdash;are
excellent in their way, and diffuse much <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>benefit and
comfort among the aged and indigent; but still our ancient
charities, especially our schools and almshouses, whilst they
secure to their recipients permanent, not precarious good, shed a
brilliant lustre over the land, and denote the kind and benignant
spirit of many of our ancestors.&nbsp; Would that the old
benevolent English spirit were revived among us, and that all
affluent men, who have possessed their money by inheritance, or
obtained it by the force of their talents, or success in trade or
commerce, would, among their testamentary bequests, never fail to
&ldquo;remember the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then should we have
comfortable asylums for many hoary-headed men and women, who,
reduced by misfortune, or overwhelmed by the distressing
calamities of life, have no place of quiet shelter&mdash;no
resting-place in which to pass the residue of their days.</p>
<p>The following list of Charitable Donations, left for the
benefit of the poor of Oswestry, shows that in days gone by, the
weak were not overlooked by the strong, and that many, imbued
with practical Christian benevolence, deemed it their duty to
aid, not only the poor of their own days, but those also of
succeeding generations.&nbsp; The only Aims-Houses in the town
are those situated near the turnpike-gate in Willow-Street.&nbsp;
They are six in number, and were left by Dame Ellen, widow of Sir
Francis Eure.&nbsp; Mrs. Jane Owen, in 1732, bequeathed to the
twelve poor persons (six men and six women), inmates of the
alms-houses, the sum of 18s. to be paid to them yearly, for ever,
and also ordered her executor to charge her real and personal
estate with the payment thereof.&nbsp; Mrs. M. Ormsby, by her
will in 1805, requested her daughter (the present Mrs. Ormsby
Gore), and those who should succeed her in the Porkington Estate,
would pay &ldquo;as she had done,&rdquo; the poor people in the
alms-houses for ever.&nbsp; Mrs. Ormsby Gore regularly
distributes &pound;3 among the inmates on Christmas-Day, that
being the sum her mother had previously given.&nbsp; The
alms-houses are kept in good repair by Mrs. Ormsby Gore, and she
selects the inmates.</p>

class="smcap">for</span> BETTERING <span class="smcap">the</span>
CONDITION <span class="smcap">of the</span> POOR,</h4>
<p>Within the Hundred of Oswestry, was established in or about
the year 1812, by the late Rev. C. A. A. Lloyd, Rector of
Whittington, and the late Rev. G. N. K. Lloyd, Rector of
Selattyn.&nbsp; The objects of the Society at its original
institution were&mdash;the encouragement of schools for the
education of the lower classes; the increase of the comforts of
the poor in their dwellings, by the improvement of cottages; the
distribution of moral and religious books and tracts; the
encouragement and promotion of friendly societies; the
establishment of a bank for the poor, paying interest for small
sums; and, finally, the distribution of rewards among the poor
for extraordinary acts of industry.</p>
<p>During the progress of the Society very much has been done in
the neighbourhood, through its instrumentality, with <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>regard to
the above objects.&nbsp; Several schools were established soon
after its commencement, and a vast number of moral and religious
publications have been given as prizes, from time to time, to the
best-informed children, and also as rewards for proficiency in
writing, drawing, sewing, &amp;c.&nbsp; With respect to the
improvement of cottages, the Society issued several small
publications some years ago, directing the attention of owners of
property to this very important social amelioration; some plans
were also engraved, and rules printed, relative to the building
of habitations for the poor.&nbsp; Through the influence of this
institution some Friendly Societies were established, and also
(which is well worthy of notice) a Savings&rsquo; Bank for the
poor, about four years <i>before</i> the present excellent
institution commenced operations in conformity with an Act of
Parliament passed on the subject.&nbsp; As soon as the Government
Savings&rsquo; Bank was opened, the funds of the former were
transferred to it.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the Society, since the loss of its
benevolent founders, has been in a declining state; but it is to
be hoped that an institution which has effected so much social
and domestic comfort, and advanced the cause of morality and
vital religion, will not, in this wealthy district, be allowed to
expire for want of support.&nbsp; Franklin has well observed,
that &ldquo;more will be done for the happiness of the poor by
inuring them to provide for themselves, than could be done by
dividing all your estates among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; To establish
principles of self-reliance among a people is to secure to them
respectability and a manly independence of character.</p>
<h4>FRIENDLY SOCIETIES.</h4>
<p>There are several Friendly Societies in Oswestry, all of which
are conducted with prudence and judgment, and are at present in a
state of prosperity.&nbsp; The following is a list of these
institutions:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE PARISH CHURCH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> ancient fabric, though having
no pretensions to beauty of architecture, externally or
internally, yet, from its size and the massiveness of its
ivy-mantled tower, has a venerable and somewhat imposing
aspect.&nbsp; Girded on the west side by noble elm trees, and on
the north by an avenue of limes, its tower presents on every side
an object of much interest in the surrounding country.&nbsp; The
eye even of the casual observer cannot fail to remark how much
the fabric has suffered in former times, little probably of the
original structure remaining.&nbsp; The different styles of
architecture in the present building might enable the antiquary
to decide with some probability when each particular part was
restored.&nbsp; The only windows possessing any architectural
beauty are those in St. Mary&rsquo;s chancel, and it is to be
lamented that, when the south side of the chancel was restored
some years ago, the new windows were not made uniform with
these.&nbsp; At present nothing can be more incongruous than the
different styles which present themselves on every side.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There are perhaps few churches, in a parish so large and
important as Oswestry, which contain so meagre a collection of
records relating to it.&nbsp; Doubtless many of the books
belonging to it were lost during the disturbed times which ended
in the establishment of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; The old Vicarage
House is supposed to have been burnt down, either at this time or
in some former incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp; It stood on the
north side of the church-yard, and when this site <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>was
exchanged with the late Mr. Lloyd, of Swan Hill, by the then
Vicar, for what is now the New Church-Yard, and which then became
the Vicar&rsquo;s Croft, the row of trees forming the north side
of the avenue, though separated by a wall from the church-yard,
was expressly reserved as belonging to the church; and the
present owner of that property has no right to cut down, or even
to lop, the trees; whilst the Vicar has at all times power to
enter upon the premises to plant new trees, if any of the present
ones should be blown down or injured.&nbsp; The croft which
became the Vicar&rsquo;s, by the above exchange with Mr. Lloyd,
was again exchanged by the late Lord Powis for what is now the
Vicar&rsquo;s land in Salop Road, and Lord Powis then gave the
croft thus obtained as a free gift to the parish for a new
Burial-ground.&nbsp; This, however, is already nearly filled, and
as the Old Church-yard ought unquestionably to be shut up and
disused for burials, another and a larger Burial-ground is much
needed.</p>
<p>In the year 1748 Mrs. Margaret Godolphin endeavoured to remedy
the loss of the old Vicarage House, by leaving to the Vicar and
his successors for the time being a small tenement at the back of
Cross-Street, as a residence, but coupled with this proviso, that
if the Vicar should not occupy it himself, then it was to be let
by the Churchwardens, and the rent appropriated in putting out
apprentices from amongst the poor.&nbsp; It does not appear that
the house so given by Mrs. Godolphin was ever occupied by any
Vicar, and it consequently fell at once under the second
provision of the will, and became a sort of Poor-house for the
town.&nbsp; This continued till the year 1823, when the house was
exchanged for more desirable premises in Brook-Street, which were
for many years occupied by the present Vicar; but in consequence
of his non-residence, through ill health, the property has been
given up by him, and has once more reverted to the second purpose
of the charity.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>The
antiquity of the church, as we have already intimated, is not
clearly defined in any of the books relating to the history of
the county.&nbsp; In the records of the Augmentation Office the
following minutes are made in reference to the Rectory and
Vicarage of Oswestry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Church of Oswestry is doubtless of
great antiquity.&nbsp; There was certainly a vicarage here
antecedent to the formation of the Valor by Pope Nicholas IV.,

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From this it is evident that the vicarial
endowment of Oswestry must be of a date prior to 1291; and in all
probability, therefore, so ancient as to preclude the expectation
of its being extant,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of Oswestry was, in early times, given to
the Monastery of Shrewsbury, and afterwards appropriated thereto,
and the rectory and tithes converted to the uses of the said
monastery.&nbsp; They continued to belong to the monastery until,
as one of the great religious houses, Shrewsbury was, by force of
the statute of 31 Henry VIII., dissolved, when its tithes and
other possessions came into the hands of the crown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tithes of Oswestry afterwards became the property of the
Earl of Arundel, Lord of Oswestry, and then of the Earl of Powis,
who sold them in 1819 (excepting the liberties of Oswestry town
and Middleton township) to Mr. W. Lloyd, of Aston, Mr. T. N.
Parker, of Sweeney, the Hon. T. Kenyon, of Pradoe, and
others.</p>
<p>Within the tower of the church are eight silver-toned bells,
whose joyous peals on occasions of festivity give hilarity to <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>all who
hear them.&nbsp; A new clock was substituted for an old one in
1836, the cost of which was paid by public subscription.</p>
<p>The church is dedicated to St. Mary.&nbsp; A new organ was
erected by subscription in 1812; and the organist, by the
adoption of effective sacred music, and the choir, by its able
execution of the beautiful psalmody selected, contribute much to
the solemnity and effect of public worship in this venerable
church.&nbsp; The present Organist is Mr. Edward Eyeley.&nbsp; It
is stated that the old organ, a fine-toned instrument, is fixed
in one of the metropolitan churches.</p>
<p>The interior of the church, especially on a Sabbath morning,
when a numerous congregation generally assembles, presents a most
delightful spectacle.&nbsp; The place where, for ages past,
divine worship has been held, and the footsteps of grandsires and
great-grandsires have led them to bow before the &ldquo;throne of
the heavenly grace,&rdquo; cannot fail to exhibit an affecting
scene to all who understand the frailty and brevity of human
life.</p>
<p>The church was enlarged and beautified in 1807: and in 1831 a
new entrance door was completed at the east or chancel end.&nbsp;
A great improvement in the interior, both as to comfort and
effect, would still be added, were a new set of pews
erected.&nbsp; Many of the present pews are most unsightly and
inconvenient.&nbsp; A new set, formed on the most approved
principle of church seat-accommodation, would be acceptable to
all pew-holders, giving neatness and adding comfort within the
fabric which every member of the congregation would heartily
approve.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the parish have accomplished
much, in the way of public improvement, within the last few
years; and the alterations we have now suggested would be a
crowning point to their spirited exertions for the benefit and
honour of the town..&nbsp; The altar-piece might be removed, and
a more suitable one introduced, at a trifling expense.</p>
<p>The Communion Plate belonging to the church consists of the
following articles:&mdash;A silver cup, bearing the inscription,
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Ex Dono Dauidi Edwards&rdquo;; another cup,
dated 1575, the gift of &ldquo;Richard Stanni,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Elder Mercer&rdquo;; a silver flagon, the letters
&ldquo;I. H. S.&rdquo; engraved thereon, with the inscription,
&ldquo;Given for the use of the Holy Communion, in the Parish
Church of Oswestry, 1707&rdquo;; and two silver salvers, the gift
of Mrs. Elizabeth Roderick.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Church-Yard</span> is no ordinary
resting-spot for the dead.&nbsp; As we have already said, it
would be well now to close it as a place of sepulture.&nbsp;
Sanitary motives would urge this change; and the feelings of
those whose departed relatives or friends are about to be
consigned to the grave should be religiously deferred to.&nbsp;
The Church-yard may soon be surrounded by human dwellings, and
then the newly-laid dead will lie amidst the busy living.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Its beautiful avenue, rendered still more pleasant in spring,
summer, and autumn, by the lofty row of lime-trees which
separates it from the space appropriated to the tenements of the
dead, might be made still more impressive in character, were a
neat lattice-work constructed, extending from tree to tree, to
mark the line of demarcation between the avenue and church-yard
more distinctly.&nbsp; A sketch of the Avenue, with the Alcove at
the west end, is here given, as well as the florid,
chastely-designed Gate leading to it from Church-Street.&nbsp;
This gate was put up in 1738, at the expence of the parish.&nbsp;
Country churchyards are always deeply interesting to the
contemplative and thoughtful; and Gray&rsquo;s truthful <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>and
pathetic Elegy, which appeals so powerfully to the best feelings
of our nature, has invested them, however rude and humble, with
an affecting character that touches the hearts even of the most
indifferent.&nbsp; Oswestry Church-Yard, with its aged elms of
more than a century&rsquo;s growth; its sombre yews; its stately
tombs and humble graves for patrician and plebeian dust,
&ldquo;the rich and the poor meeting together,&rdquo; is a scene
conveying monitory lessons to all who will seriously read
them.&nbsp; Among the tombs are several, bearing appropriate
inscriptions, containing the ashes of French prisoners of war,
who died in Oswestry on their parole, between the years 1811 and
1814.&nbsp; The ancient entrance to the Church-yard from Upper
Brook-Street, through the <span class="smcap">Griddle
Gate</span>, is a curious relic of byegone times.&nbsp; Formerly,
on occasions of burial from the south side of the town, the
coffin of a deceased party was placed temporarily on a bier
within the porch of the Griddle Gate, <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>and thence conveyed to the
church.&nbsp; It will be seen from the engraving we give of this
Gate that it was erected in 1631.</p>

<p>We may here state that the elm-trees in the church-yard were
planted at the expense of the Rev. Thomas Owen, when Vicar of the
Parish, between the years 1707 and 1713.</p>
<h4>Monuments and Tablets within the Church.</h4>
<p>How valuable are Monumental Inscriptions, when they are the
records of truth, and affectionate tributes to departed
worth!&nbsp; The tablets on our church walls are silent, but
often effective monitors, reviving drooping spirits, recalling
scenes of sublunary enjoyments, transient as the stay of the
dew-drop in the sun, and suggesting the brevity and uncertainty
of human existence.&nbsp; Within Oswestry Church, as well as in
its grave-yard, most of the Monuments and Inscriptions are
simple, chaste, and impressive.&nbsp; They either plainly mark
the spot where lies the departed body, or touchingly express the
natural grief of surviving relatives or friends.&nbsp; Whilst
wandering among the habitations of the dead, and viewing, with
&ldquo;slow and solemn steps,&rdquo; the houses, for rich and
poor, &ldquo;appointed for all men living,&rdquo; we can
sympathize with Salopia&rsquo;s own sweet poet, in his beautiful
apostrophe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou, sainted Memory, art mine,<br />
And smiling Hope, of birth divine,<br />
Ev&rsquo;n now I feel your mingled pow&rsquo;r,<br />
Ev&rsquo;n in this solitary hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the north wall, within the church, is an ancient monument
exhibiting a male and female kneeling.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In memory of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hugh

Mary&rsquo;s, before its demolition in the late wars, anno

<h3>TRINITY CHURCH.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p148b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The great want of accommodation for the poor in the Parish
Church led to the building of another church, in the outskirts of
the town, in the year 1835.&nbsp; This church, dedicated to the
<span class="smcap">Holy Trinity</span>, was consecrated by the
Bishop of St. Asaph (Dr. Carey) in 1837, and a district,
consisting of the wards of Leg-Street and Beatrice Street, in the
town, <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>and of the townships of Middleton, Hisland, Wootton,
Aston., and Maesbury, has since been formed for it by the Church
Commissioners.&nbsp; The population of the district so assigned
was estimated at the time at about 2,300.&nbsp; The church
contains accommodation for 700 persons, for about 400 of whom
there are free sittings.&nbsp; The ornamental parts of the
interior were executed at the expense of the Rev. John Parker, of
Sweeney Hall, Vicar of Llanyblodwel.&nbsp; The Viscount Dungannon
presented a handsome bible and prayer book, and the communion
services, for the use of the church.&nbsp; The communion plate
was given by the late Earl of Powis.&nbsp; T. L. Longueville,
Esq., has also been a most liberal contributor to the church,
both in presenting an organ, and in subscribing largely to the
original structure, and to the subsequent improvements.&nbsp; A
school-room at Maesbury, with a house for the master, was built
some years since in this district, and subsequently licensed for
the performance of worship by the Bishop of St. Asaph, and which
is served gratuitously by the Incumbent of Trinity Church.&nbsp;
It is much to be desired that a chapel-of-ease were erected in
this part of the parish.&nbsp; Trinity Church is now altogether
separated from the living of Oswestry, the Vicar of Oswestry for
the time being appointing the Incumbent.&nbsp; The present
Incumbent is the Rev. Frederick Cashel, M.A.</p>
<h3>TREFONEN CHURCH.</h3>
<p>To meet the wants of the Welsh population of the parish, a
church was built in the township of Trefonen, and consecrated in
the year 1821; and in 1842 a district was assigned to it, by an
Order in Council bearing date August 27th, consisting of the
three townships of Trefonen, Treflach, and Treferclawdd.&nbsp; In
1851 this district contained 319 houses, and 1233
inhabitants&mdash;viz., 589 males and 644 females.</p>
<p>Trefonen Church, which is capable of containing about 500
persons, was built on a piece of land given for that purpose <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>by the late
Sir W. W. Wynn, father of the present Baronet.&nbsp; It was
originally intended that the service of this church should be
wholly in Welsh; but, owing to the increase and prevalence of the
English language, that intention was not persevered in, and the
service has for some years past been performed in Welsh and
English alternately.&nbsp; A substantial school-room, with a
house for the Master, was erected in the year 1825, upon a
portion of the glebe given for that purpose, with the sanction of
the Bishop, by the late Incumbent, the Rev. Edward Jones, and
which has been of great advantage to the district.&nbsp; The
living is a perpetual curacy, in the patronage of the Earl of
Powis.&nbsp; The present Incumbent is the Rev. D. Lloyd.</p>
<p>Trefonen abounds in mineral wealth.&nbsp; Coal was raised in
considerable abundance some years since in the adjoining township
of Treferclawdd, but the pits there are now exhausted.&nbsp; It
is still worked, however, in the township of Treflach, where
there are also valuable and extensive quarries of lime.&nbsp; A
mine was opened some years since in the Moelydd, which produces
lead and calamine.</p>
<h3>RHYDYCROESAU CHURCH.</h3>
<p>In addition to the above means of providing church
accommodation to the inhabitants of the parish, an additional
advantage has been gained by annexing the two Welsh townships of
Pentregaer and Cynynion to the new church at Rhydycroesau.&nbsp;
This church is situated on the high road to Llansilin, about
three and a half miles from the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; It owes
its foundation to the Rev. G. N. K. Lloyd, late Rector of
Selattyn, who contributed liberally himself, and, with the
co-operation of the first and present Incumbent, the Rev. Robert
Williams, M.A., raised a sufficient fund, by voluntary
contributions, to complete the church and erect a
glebe-house.&nbsp; The church was consecrated August 2nd, 1838,
by the Bishop of St. Asaph, and the glebe-house was built <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>in
1840.&nbsp; It is a Consolidated District Church, licensed for
all parochial purposes; and has a legally-assigned district,
consisting of the townships of Cynynion and Pentregaer, in the
parish of Oswestry; a detached portion of the parish of
Llanyblodwel, called Cefnymaes; with portions of the parishes of
Llansilin and Selattyn.&nbsp; A very neat Gothic building has
also been erected by the present Incumbent, aided by voluntary
contributions, and opened as a National School in January,
1850.&nbsp; The sites for the school and playground, as well as
for the church and church-yard, are the munificent gifts of Sir
Watkin Williams Wynn, Bart.&nbsp; The portion of the population
of the parish of Oswestry thus transferred to the district of
Rhydycroesau is about 200.</p>
<p>Nothing is now needed to make the ecclesiastical arrangements
of the parish of Oswestry complete but the building of a
chapel-of-ease at Maesbury, and the annexing a district to Morton
Chapel; the latter of which objects will no doubt be effected
whenever a new Incumbent shall be appointed to it.</p>
<p>Oswestry is a discharged Vicarage, in the gift of the Earl of
Powis.&nbsp; The present Incumbent is the Rev. Thomas Salwey,
B.D.</p>

<p>The present esteemed Vicar of Oswestry, suffering much from
illness, has long been unable to attend personally to the duties
of his office.&nbsp; When however occasion has offered to
promote, by his counsel and aid, any measure of benevolence in
the Parish, he has been active in the good work.&nbsp; There are
two Curates at present attached to the Parish Church&mdash;the
Rev. Llewelyn Wynne Jones, and the Rev. George Cuthbert, both of
whom are zealous and faithful in their ministerial labours, and
have acquired the regard and affection of the numerous
congregations to whom they dispense the Bread of Life.</p>
<h3>Dissenting Places of Worship.</h3>
<h4>THE OLD CHAPEL.</h4>
<p>The Congregational Church of Protestant Dissenters now
assembling in the Old Chapel, Arthur-Street, was formed in the
township of Sweeney, in the year 1662, and the Rev. Rowland
Nevet, A, M., ejected from the vicarage of Oswestry <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>by the Act
of Uniformity, was its first pastor.&nbsp; Mr. Nevet laboured in
the ministry for thirty years; seventeen as a clergyman of the
established church, and thirteen as a dissenting preacher.&nbsp;
Calamy, in his &ldquo;<i>Nonconformists&rsquo;
Memorial</i>,&rdquo; mentions to his honour, that when the Plague
prevailed at Oswestry, he still continued with his people,
extending to them both temporal and spiritual aid.&nbsp; He died
December 8th, 1675, and was succeeded by the Rev. James Owen, a
distinguished minister, who bore part, as we have already
mentioned, in a theological controversy which took place in the
Oswestry Guildhall, in the year 1681, in the presence of Bishop
Lloyd.&nbsp; He was appointed pastor at Sweeney in November,
1676, the duties of which office he faithfully discharged, as
well as those of chaplain to Mrs. Baker, a pious lady residing on
her own estate at Sweeney Hall.&nbsp; Vestiges of the ancient
burial-ground of the first Nonconformists are yet to be seen near
the site of the old mansion at Sweeney, enclosed within iron
railings by the late T. N. Parker, Esq.&nbsp; The following
inscriptions are still legible:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lieth Mrs. <span class="smcap">Abigail
Chetwood</span>, daughter to Sir Richard Chetwood, who died the
1st May, 1658.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thomas Baker</span>, Esq., deceased
March 19, aged 68, A.D. 1675.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above Thomas Baker served the office of High Sheriff of
the county, in 1649, the first year of Cromwell&rsquo;s
Protectorate; and in the parliament of 1653 he was summoned by
Cromwell, with John Brown, of Little Ness, as a knight of the
shire.&nbsp; In 1692 the place of worship was removed, for
convenience, from Sweeney into the town of Oswestry.&nbsp; The
room fitted up for religious worship was part of a house in
Willow-Street, now known as the Butchers&rsquo; Arms.&nbsp; Here
Mr. Owen laboured for eight years, and then removed to
Shrewsbury, where he was soon placed at the head of the
dissenting theological seminary.&nbsp; He was succeeded by the
Rev. Jenkyn Evans, who died in 1709, and his funeral sermon was
preached by the celebrated Mathew Henry.&nbsp; The Rev. Joseph <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Venables
was the next minister appointed; and after Mr. Venables came the
Rev. Thomas Morgan.&nbsp; During his ministry the site on which
the present chapel and chapel-house stand was purchased, with an
old maltkiln upon it, for &pound;38.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;200
having been given for the purpose by Mrs. Sarah Lloyd, a chapel
was erected, and opened for public worship in July, 1750.&nbsp;
The immediate successors of Mr. Morgan were Mr. Davies and Mr.
Dewhurst; the latter became Socinian or Arian in his doctrines,
and soon left.&nbsp; In September, 1777, the Rev. Dr. Edward
Williams removed from Ross to Oswestry.&nbsp; In 1783 he enlarged
the chapel; and the Collegiate Institution at Abergavenny having
been removed to Oswestry, Dr. Williams became its Tutor, and for
the accommodation of the students he enlarged the chapel-house
also.&nbsp; In 1791 he removed to Carr&rsquo;s-Lane, Birmingham;
afterwards to Rotherham College, of which he was appointed
Principal, and there he died.&nbsp; The Rev. John Whitridge, who
had been minister of the Congregational Church at
Newcastle-under-Lyme for nine years, succeeded Dr. Williams, and
he remained the kind and benevolent pastor of his congregation,
which greatly increased under his ministry, till the period of
his death, October 11th, 1826.&nbsp; On the west side of the
chapel, and over the spot where the pulpit then stood, in which
for thirty-five years he had dealt out the bread of life to his
congregation, a plain marble tablet was erected, bearing the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Memory of the Rev. <span
class="smcap">John Whitridge</span>, this Tablet is
affectionately inscribed by the Church over whom for 35 years he
was the devoted Pastor.&nbsp; An example&mdash;in word&mdash;in
conversation&mdash;in charity&mdash;in spirit&mdash;in
faith&mdash;in purity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whose praise is in the Gospel
throughout all the Churches.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was born 23rd March,
1760.&nbsp; Died 11th October, 1826.&nbsp; His body reposes in a
tomb beneath, waiting the spirit&rsquo;s union at the
resurrection of the just.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Jenkyn, of Wem, succeeded to the pastoral office, and
afterwards the Rev. W. Reeve.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Davies was
followed by the present able pastor, the Rev. James Matheson <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>(son of the
Rev. Dr. Matheson, the indefatigable Secretary of the Home
Missionary Society), who entered upon his ministerial labours in
September, 1851, and who, by his distinguished talents, great
urbanity, and ardent zeal for the spiritual prosperity of his
people, has succeeded in greatly increasing the number of his
hearers, and in commending himself to the good opinion of all
classes of his fellow-townsmen.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The present Chapel (of which we give a sketch) was built
during the ministry of the Rev. Dr. Jenkyn.&nbsp; The old Chapel
having become too small for the increased number of hearers, it
was pulled down, with the exception of part of one wall, and the
present one was erected.&nbsp; It is a substantial and commodious
place of worship, and capable of containing, when closely seated,
about eight hundred persons.</p>
<h4>THE BAPTIST CHAPEL,</h4>
<p>Situated on the English Walls (opposite the Cattle Market),
was erected by voluntary contributions, in the year 1805, and
enlarged in 1818.&nbsp; It contains two galleries, and will
accommodate between 300 and 400 persons.&nbsp; The Baptist Church
in Oswestry was formed September 6th, 1806, and then consisted of
a few members dismissed from the Baptist <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Church, at
Shrewsbury, at that time under the pastoral care of the late Rev.
John Palmer, who, with other Baptist Ministers, preached the
Gospel in Oswestry and its neighbourhood some time prior to the
erection of the Chapel.&nbsp; The Rev. William Pain was the first
Pastor, and was succeeded by the Rev. Thomas Cooke, in the year
1817, who, for twenty years, honourably sustained the office to
which he had been chosen.&nbsp; In 1838 the Rev. Robert Clarke
(late of Bridgnorth) became the Pastor; and his successor was the
late Rev. H. G. Grainger, who settled in Oswestry, in the year
1846.&nbsp; The present Pastor, the Rev. David Crumpton, took the
oversight of the Church in the year 1852.&nbsp; There is a
Sabbath-School connected with this congregation.&nbsp; The Chapel
is free from debt, as is also the Baptist Chapel at Sweeney,
erected by this Church and congregation in the year 1831.</p>
<h4>THE WESLEYAN-METHODIST CHAPEL</h4>
<p>Is a plain brick building, situated in the Coney Green, and
was erected in the year 1813.&nbsp; The interior is without
galleries, but will accommodate on the ground floor about 500
persons.&nbsp; The Wesleyan body in Oswestry is included in the
Wrexham Circuit, the present Superintendent being the Rev. Samuel
Atkinson.</p>
<h4>ZION CHAPEL.</h4>
<p>Throughout the Principality the Calvinistic Methodists are the
most numerous body of dissenters, and their annual meetings, or
associations, are seasons of much interest and excitement.&nbsp;
In 1814 a small chapel was erected on the Welsh Walls for the
accommodation of persons of this persuasion resident in Oswestry,
and this was occupied as a place of religious worship until 1836,
when the great increase of the congregation rendered the erection
of a larger chapel necessary.&nbsp; Accordingly the present
building was commenced in Gatacre Place, and opened for public
worship on the 6th of July, 1836.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>It is
a substantial stone structure, of rather imposing appearance, and
affords accommodation for upwards of 500 persons.</p>
<h4>THE PRIMITIVE METHODIST CHAPEL.</h4>
<p>The first chapel erected by this body was on the site of the
Bath in Upper Willow Street, and was opened in 1825.&nbsp; So
rapid has been the increase of the members of this denomination,
that from the summer of 1825, when their first travelling
preacher visited Oswestry, to the present time, they have built
in this circuit no fewer than sixteen chapels; and the number of
preachers on their quarterly plan amounts to 120.&nbsp; Their
place of worship in Willow Street having become incapable of
accommodating their increasing numbers, the present chapel and
chapel-house were erected in 1840, in Castle Street.&nbsp; It is
a neat and convenient building, and will seat about 450
persons.&nbsp; The Superintendent is the Rev. Thomas Parr.</p>
<h4>BETHESDA CHAPEL</h4>
<p>Is a small neat building in Castle Street, erected in the year
1844, for the use of the Welsh Congregationalists, or
Independents.&nbsp; The Rev. Robert Thomas is the present
Minister.</p>
<h4>THE INDEPENDENT METHODIST CHAPEL</h4>
<p>Stands below the Horse-Market, and was built in 1848 by a body
of seceders from the Primitive Methodists.&nbsp; It is a plain
brick building, and capable of seating about 300 persons.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Besides the above, there is a small but highly-respectable
body of Christians who hold their meetings in the Assembly Room
at Osburn&rsquo;s Hotel, under the ministry of the Rev. J,
Stewart; and also a congregation of Welsh Wesleyan-Methodists,
who assemble in a school-room at Black Gate.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Municipal and Civil Government.</h2>
<p>The Corporation of Oswestry is of great antiquity.&nbsp; Its
civic honours, primitively, flowed from its Barons or Lords, who,
exercising themselves the power of petty sovereigns, appointed
Bailiff&rsquo;s and other officers to superintend the civic
affairs of the borough.&nbsp; Its first assumption of civic
dignities appears to have been in the reign of Henry II., when
William, Earl of Arundel, granted to the town a short charter
(called by the Welsh &ldquo;<i>Siarter Cwtta</i>&rdquo;),
denominated also a Charter of Protection.&nbsp; A clause in this
ancient document sets forth that &ldquo;I (the Earl of Arundel)
have received in Protection my Burgesses of Blanc-Minster&rdquo;
(Oswestry).&nbsp; Richard de Chambre was Constable at this
period.&nbsp; Here was subsidiary power given to the inhabitants
of Oswestry, for the government of the town; but in the reign of
Richard II., August 14th, 1399, that monarch granted to Oswestry
its first royal charter, incorporating the Burgesses by the name
and title of &ldquo;The Bailiffs and Burgesses of Oswestry,
<i>infra Palatinatum Cestri&aelig;</i>, <i>in marchia inter
Angliam et Walliam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1407, as heretofore
noticed, Thomas, Earl of Arundel, granted a comprehensive and
valuable charter, showing that still the exercise of power, in
his lordship or barony, for the good government of the burgesses,
&amp;c., was fully recognized by the crown.</p>
<p>The rights and privileges granted by Richard II. seem to have
been strictly guarded and maintained by the inhabitants down to
the reign of Elizabeth, when they were confirmed by that
sovereign.&nbsp; It would appear, however, that subsequently
&ldquo;divers doubts and ambiguities&rdquo; arose concerning the
ancient liberties, franchises, &amp;c., of the borough, and in
the reign of James I., 1616, the king granted a charter to the
town, extending its liberties and privileges, and confirming the
Bailiffs, Burgesses, &amp;c., as a body corporate, by the <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>name of
&ldquo;The Bailiff and Burgesses of Oswestry, in the countie of
Salop.&rdquo;&nbsp; The charter of Charles II., granted January
13th, 1673, to &ldquo;the ancient borough and corporation of
Oswestry, alias Oswaldstrey, in the county of Salop,&rdquo;
enacted &ldquo;That they be incorporated by the name of the
Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Councilmen and Burgesses of
Oswestry.&rdquo;&nbsp; This charter, it will be seen, was the
instrument which first called into existence the offices of
Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Councilmen, and Recorder.&nbsp; That
charter was immediately acted upon, and Mr. Richard Pope was
elected <i>the first Mayor of Oswestry</i>.&nbsp; Sir John
Trevor, Knight (afterwards speaker of the House of Commons, and
Master of the Rolls), Morgan Wynne, Esq., Edward Owen, Richard
Edwards, Richard Lloyd, the before-mentioned Richard Pope,
gentleman; Gabriel Edwards, woollen-draper; Hugh Price,
woollen-draper; John Jones, mercer; Richard Jones, John Blodwell,
gentlemen; and John Lloyd, mercer, were chosen as <i>the first
Aldermen</i>.&nbsp; Richard Price, brewer, Richard Jones, mercer,
John Glover, tanner, Richard Jones, glover, Edward Evans,
apothecary, John Jones, glover, John Muckleston, shoemaker,
Thomas Edwards, gentleman, Thomas Edwards, baker, Nathaniel
Jones, brewer, Hugh Edwards, shoemaker, Timothy George, mercer,
Thomas Vaughan, chandler, William Price, butcher, and Thomas
Felton, brazier, were <i>the first Common-Councilmen</i>.&nbsp;
Morgan Wynne, Esq., was <i>the first Recorder</i> of the town,
and John Worral, Esq., first Common Clerk of the Borough, and
Clerk of the Court.&nbsp; It may be mentioned as a fact worth
knowing, that Sir John Trevor was the <i>second</i> Mayor of
Oswestry, under the charter of Charles II.&nbsp; Sir John was an
eminent man, and his history, connected as he was with the
borough of Oswestry, is worthy of brief record in these
pages.&nbsp; He was the second son of John Trevor, Esq., of
Brynkinalt, in the county of Denbigh, by an aunt of Sir George
Jeffreys.&nbsp; He was born about the year 1637, and it is
supposed never received educational advantages beyond <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>those
furnished by a village school.&nbsp; He was sent to London to his
uncle, Arthur Trevor, a leading barrister, who employed him as
his clerk in his chambers in the Inner Temple.&nbsp; The Rev.
Robert Williams, in his careful and elaborate
&ldquo;<i>Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Welshmen</i>,&rdquo;
says of him, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On his first arrival he displayed very
lively parts, although his manners were rather uncouth, and he
could not speak a sentence of correct English.&nbsp; His
diligence, however, was so great, that being entered a student of
the Inner Temple, he rendered himself well versed in all branches
of his profession, and soon acquired extensive practice.&nbsp;
Through the interest of his cousin, Sir George Jeffreys, he was
made a king&rsquo;s counsel, in 1678, and he obtained a seat in
the House of Commons.&nbsp; Here he acquired considerable
influence among the members, and such was his reputation as a
high prerogative lawyer, that at the meeting of James II&rsquo;s.
parliament in May, 1685, he was elected Speaker.&nbsp; In October
of the same year he was appointed Master of the Rolls, and in
July, 1688, he was sworn a Privy Councillor.&nbsp; On the
accession of William and Mary, Sir John Trevor was dismissed from
the office of Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; In the Convention
Parliament he sat for Beraldstone, and opposed by every means in
his power the measures of the Government.&nbsp; In the next
Parliament, called in 1690, he made his peace with the Court, and
was unanimously elected Speaker.&nbsp; In May, 1691, he was made
first Lord Commissioner of the Great Seal, which office he held
until May 2nd, 1693, and in January, 1693 he was restored to his
office of Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; Such was his talent for
managing party, and of recommending himself to the Government by
his bold and dexterous measures, that had it not been for his
great indiscretion, he would probably have reached the great
object of his ambition, which was to become Lord Chancellor, and
to be created a peer.&nbsp; In 1695 a violent outcry was raised
against bribery, and a committee was appointed by the House of
Commons, to inquire into the charges, which were <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>made
against members, and it reported that Sir John Trevor had
received a bribe of a thousand guineas for furthering a bill
called the &lsquo;Orphan&rsquo;s Bill,&rsquo; promoted by the
City of London.&nbsp; Accordingly, March 12th, 1695, he was
subjected to the unparalleled humiliation of putting the
resolution from the chair, and declaring himself guilty.&nbsp; He
then resigned the chair, and was expelled from the House.&nbsp;
Receiving money for voting in parliament was in those days so
common, that his offence was not regarded in a very serious
light, and he was permitted to retain his high judicial office of
Master of the Rolls, for the long period of twenty-two years
after his expulsion from the House of Commons.&nbsp; By the death
of his elder brother he succeeded to the paternal estates of
Brynkinalt, which, with large possessions of his own acquisition,
have descended through his only daughter Anne to the present
Viscount Dungannon.&nbsp; Sir John Trevor died May 20th, 1717,
being nearly eighty years of age, at his house in Chancery Lane,
and was buried in the Rolls Chapel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yorke, in his &ldquo;<i>Royal Tribes of Wales</i>,&rdquo;
relates a droll anecdote of Sir&rsquo; John, which is worthy of
transplantation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Among his other virtues,&rdquo; says Yorke,
&ldquo;Trevor was an economist.&nbsp; He had dined by himself one
day at the Rolls, and was drinking his wine quietly, when his
cousin Roderic Lloyd was unexpectedly introduced to him from a
side door.&nbsp; &lsquo;You rascal,&rsquo; said Trevor to his
servant, &lsquo;and you have brought my cousin Roderic Lloyd,
Esquire, Prothonotary of North Wales, Marshal to Baron Price, and
so forth, and so forth, up my <i>back stairs</i>.&nbsp; Take my
cousin Roderic Lloyd, Esquire, Prothonotary of North Wales,
Marshal to Baron Price, and so forth, and so forth; take him
instantly back, down my <i>back stairs</i>, and bring him up my
<i>front stairs</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Roderic in vain remonstrated,
and whilst he was conveyed down one, and up the other stairs, his
Honor removed the bottle and glasses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trevor had an obliquity of vision, or, in plainer words, he
squinted abominably!&nbsp; When he was expelled from the House of
Commons for bribery, pasquinades <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>were issued against him, in one of
which it was wittily said, that &ldquo;Justice was blind, but
Bribery only squinted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charter of the 25 Charles II. (which was the governing
charter previous to the passing of the Municipal Reform Act,)
granted to the Borough of Oswestry a general Court of Quarter
Sessions, to be held before the Mayor, the Steward, and the
Recorder, or any two of them, of whom the Mayor was to be
one.&nbsp; On the passing of that Act the Government refused to
renew the grant of a separate Quarter Sessions, although strong
and unanimous petitions from the town were presented in favour of
this privilege.&nbsp; In 1842, however, when the Ministry of Sir
Robert Peel was in office, Sir James Graham being Secretary of
State for the Home Department, the application was renewed, and
was ultimately complied with.&nbsp; The grant is dated the 27th
May, 1842, and under it John Robert Kenyon, Esq., was appointed
Recorder.&nbsp; The first Quarter Sessions, under this grant,
were held on July 8th in the same year.&nbsp; Mr. Kenyon has ably
and impartially discharged the duties of Recorder since that
period; and to his legal acumen and zealous interest for the
borough the inhabitants are indebted for many advantages.</p>
<p>The Corporation are chosen from the respectable and
enterprising classes of the borough, so that all men who by
perseverance and success in trade or commerce, in the learned
profession of the law, or medical science, or who move in the
quieter and more elevated ranks of life, where the <i>otium cum
dignitate</i> is to be seen in perfection,&mdash;if to be seen
anywhere,&mdash;are in the legitimate path to Magisterial
authority and Aldermanic greatness.</p>
<p>The Municipal Act came into operation in Oswestry in January,
1836.&nbsp; James Edwards, Esq., was elected Mayor of the borough
in 1834, and held office, pursuant to the new Act, until January
1st, 1836, on which day John Croxon, Esq., was elected the
<i>first Mayor</i> under the Municipal Reform <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Act, and
continued in office till November 9th, 1836, when Francis
Campbell, Esq., was elected as the <i>second</i> Mayor of the
borough under the same Act.</p>
<p>The Hon. Thomas Kenyon (second son of the celebrated Lord
Kenyon, and father of the present Recorder of Oswestry) was
appointed High Steward of the Borough in the year 1823.&nbsp; Mr.
Richard Jones Croxon (who had succeeded Mr. Lewis Jones to the
Town-Clerkship in 1834) was appointed Town-Clerk under the
Municipal Act, and has continued to perform the duties of that
office to the present time, with great credit to himself and
satisfaction to the town.</p>
<p>Under the New Corporation Act the borough was divided into two
Wards, viz., the <i>East Ward</i>, comprising 148 burgesses, and
the <i>West Ward</i>, numbering 166 burgesses.</p>

<h3>OSWESTRY CASTLE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers will have already
learnt that Oswestry, from an early period in the history of the
nation, bore no undistinguished part.&nbsp; Fixed in the midst of
an arena of fierce and convulsive conflicts for many ages; its
early state of warlike defence, rendered so complete by the
sagacious Edward I., and forming a powerful post on the Border
Lands, the eyes of monarchs and their gallant nobles were
frequently directed towards it for succour or defence.&nbsp; The
Castle, in its primitive state, may have been a palace fit for
regal splendour.&nbsp; The honour of erecting it is assigned, as
we have previously mentioned, to Madog, descended from an
illustrious Welsh Prince, the strenuous ally of Henry II., in his
Welsh wars, and whose sire was the constant confederate of Randel
the Third, and of his son, Hugh Cyveiliog, the fourth Earl of
Chester.&nbsp; Madog was a man of high distinction in his day,
and, being Prince of Powys, of which division Oswestry formed a
part, there is presumptive evidence that the Castle was built by
him, as the Welsh historians maintain, or very considerably
enlarged or repaired.&nbsp; The English records fix its existence
even before the Norman Conquest, and show that &ldquo;Alan, a
noble Norman,&rdquo; received it immediately from William the
Conqueror, on his accession.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Alan,&rdquo; adds
Dugdale, the historian, &ldquo;was the stock of the Fitz-Alans,
Earls of Arundel; a potent race that flourished (with fewer
checks than are usual with greatness) for near five hundred
years.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be necessary to mention here, to aid
the reader as to dates, that Madog died <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1159, and that the Norman Invasion
occurred in 1066.&nbsp; If Dugdale is to be relied upon, the
Castle of Oswestry was built at a period anterior to the
Conquest, but he makes no mention of Madog.&nbsp; He says,
&ldquo;There was a Castle at <i>Oswaldster</i> at the time of the
Conquest;&rdquo; and Pennant, a good authority, adds to this note
of Dugdale, &ldquo;I think it very probable.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
able Welsh tourist further remarks, &ldquo;The artificial mount
on which it was placed indicates it to have been earlier than <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the Norman
era.&nbsp; The Britons and the Saxons gave their fortresses this
species of elevation.&nbsp; The Normans built on the firm and
natural soil or rock, but often made use of these mounts, which
they found to have been the site of a Saxon castle.&nbsp; I
believe this to have been the case with that in question.&nbsp; A
Fitz-Alan repaired or re-built, and added to that which he met
with here: a tower also (as is not unfrequent) might receive the
name of <i>Madog</i>, complimentary either to the son of
<i>Meredydd</i> (Madog&rsquo;s father), or some other great man
of the same title.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have collected all the
authorities we could find on this vexed question; but the actual
date of the building of the Castle, and the veritable party to
whom the honour of founding it is due, are still among the
undiscovered facts of ages past.</p>

<p>There is still, however, a notable event connected with
Oswestry Castle that gives to its history surpassing interest,
and ranks it among the more remarkable military relics of the
nation.&nbsp; If the pains-taking researches of Chalmers, the
historian of Scotland, are to be relied upon, one of the
distinguished occupants of Oswestry Castle was the founder of the
Stewart royal family.&nbsp; The real origin of that race of
sovereigns had long perplexed genealogists; but the labours of
Chalmers, who has minutely investigated all the written and
printed records on the subject, have proved beyond further
controversy that Walter, the son of Alan (the two first Norman
possessors of Oswestry Castle), the son of Flaald, and the
younger brother of William, the son of Alan, who was the
progenitor of the famous house of Fitz-Alan, the Earl of Arundel,
<i>was the first of the Stewarts</i>.&nbsp; Symon, and other
Scotch historians, trace the Stewart family to a Thane of
Lochabar.&nbsp; Lord Hailes disputed this and other opinions,
treating them as fabulous, but it was reserved for Chalmers to
establish and set at rest the long-contested question as to the
origin of the Stewart race.&nbsp; Lord Hailes himself
acknowledges that Walter, who flourished under David the First of
Scotland, and Malcolm the Fourth, was <i>indeed</i> the first
Stewart of Scotland; but he is unable to determine <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>where, and
what was the commencement of this family.&nbsp; The subject is
important to every native of our land; but to the people of
Oswestry it is of paramount interest, as it connects with the
town, however remotely, the genealogy of our present beloved
monarch, <span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span>.</p>
<p>Chalmers&rsquo; evidence on this subject is curious and
interesting.&nbsp; He tells us that the great exploit of Walter,
the son of Alan, was the founding of Paisley monastery, during
the reign of Malcolm IV., by transplanting a colony of Cluniac
monks from the monastery of Wenlock, in Shropshire.&nbsp; Such,
then, he adds, was the connection of Walter the First Stewart
with Wenlock, and with Isabel de Say, who married William, the
brother of Walter.&nbsp; Alan, the son of Flaald, married the
daughter of Gwarine, the famous Sheriff of Shropshire, soon after
the Norman conquest; and of this marriage William was the eldest
son of Alan, and the undoubted heir both of Alan and of
Gwarine.&nbsp; Alan, the son of Flaald, a Norman, acquired the
manor of Oswestry soon after the Conquest.&nbsp; Alan was
undoubtedly a person of great consequence at the accession of
Henry I.&nbsp; He was a frequent witness to the king&rsquo;s
charters, with other eminent personages of that court.&nbsp; Mr.
Chalmers, in his further investigations, proves the fraternal
connection of William, the son of Alan, by a transaction which
had before been as new to history as it is singular in
itself.&nbsp; It has already been shown that Oswestry was the
original seat of Alan on the Welsh border.&nbsp; Clun was added
to his family by the marriage of his son William, who built Clun
Castle; and John Fitz-Alan, Lord of Clun and Oswestry, by
marrying Isabel, the second sister of William de Albany, the
third Earl of Arundel, who died in 1196, became Earl of Arundel,
and changed his residence from Shropshire to Sussex.&nbsp; Now,
Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, being with Edward III.,
during the year 1335, and claiming to be <i>Stewart of Scotland
by hereditary right</i>, sold his title and claim to the king for
1000 marks, which purchase he cautiously had confirmed to him by
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Edward
Baliol; but Richard Fitz-Alan had not any right to the
Stewartship of Scotland.&nbsp; Walter, who was the first
purchaser of this hereditary office, was the younger brother of
William, the son of Alan, the progenitor of Richard Fitz-Alan,
the claimant; and till all the descendants of the first purchaser
had failed, the claim could not ascend to the common father of
the two families.&nbsp; But Robert the Stewart, who was born of
Margery Bruce, on the 28th March, 1315&ndash;16, and became King
of Scots the 2nd February, 1370&ndash;1, under the entail of the
crown, was then in possession of the hereditary office of
Stewart, by lineal descent.&nbsp; Walter, the son of Alan,
undoubtedly obtained from David I., and from Malcolm IV., great
possessions, a high office, and extensive patronage, and it may
be reasonably asked, by what influence he could acquire from two
kings so much opulence, and such an office?&nbsp; David I. was a
strenuous supporter of the claims of his niece, the Empress Maud,
in her severe contest with Stephen.&nbsp; William, the brother of
Walter, influenced by the Earl of Gloucester, the bastard son of
Henry I., and other powerful partizans of his sister the Empress,
seized Shrewsbury in September, 1139, and held it for her
interest.&nbsp; He attended her, with King David, at the siege of
Winchester, in 1441, where they were overpowered by the
Londoners, and obliged to flee.&nbsp; Such then were the bonds of
connection between David I. and the sons of Alan, who were also
patronized by the Earl of Gloucester.&nbsp; It was probably on
that occasion that Walter accompanied David into Scotland.&nbsp;
William, the son of Alan, adhered steadily to the Empress, and
was rewarded by Henry II. for his attachment.&nbsp; Thus Walter,
the son of Alan, could not have had more powerful protectors,
than the Earl of Gloucester with David I., and Henry II. with
Malcolm the II.&nbsp; When Walter, by those influences, obtained
grants of Renfrew with other lands, and founded the Monastery of
Paisley for Cluniac Monks from Wenlock, he was followed by
several persons from Shropshire, whom he enriched, and by whom he
was supported.&nbsp; He <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>married Eschina, of Moll, in
Roxburghshire, by whom he had a son Alan, who succeeded him in
his estates and office when he died, in 1177.&nbsp; Six descents
carried this family, by lineal transmissions, to Robert the
Stewart, whose office, as already stated, was purchased by Edward
III., and who became King of Scots 1371: Walter, the son of Alan,
was followed by his brother Simon.&nbsp; Thus does Mr. Chalmers
treat the history of the Stewarts, whose blood, he says, runs in
a thousand channels.</p>
<p>This historical subject has attracted the attention of a
talented resident of Oswestry, whose taste and research, united
with genius and poetic imagination, have already conferred upon
the town no trivial honour.&nbsp; That gentleman has favoured us
with a notice of the <span class="smcap">Castle Hill</span>,
which bespeaks the enthusiasm of the writer, and adds to the
interest which all lovers of history must feel on a topic so
closely connected with the present amiable Sovereign of the
kingdom.&nbsp; It is only due to Mr. <span
class="smcap">Sabine</span> to state (for to him we are indebted
for aid in endeavouring to elucidate a dark and hitherto
uncertain portion of Border History) that he has shed light even
upon the pains-taking researches of Chalmers, and done much
towards establishing a fact which, as we now consider it to be
&ldquo;proven,&rdquo; cannot fail to confer upon Oswestry an
historical importance of no common degree.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sabine&rsquo;s</span> paper we have
pleasure in quoting entire:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; he remarks,
&ldquo;in the appearance of this Hill very imposing or very
remarkable.&nbsp; It is a somewhat abrupt mound, with some rude
fragmentary remains of the castle, with which it was formerly
surmounted.&nbsp; It has long been a moot question whether this
mound is natural, or whether it has been raised by artificial
means.&nbsp; Its appearance would seem to indicate that it is the
work of man; but an examination of its geological composition,
and a comparison of it with similar surrounding elevations, lead
to the conclusion that it is the accumulated deposit of ages
during a period in which the district has probably been the <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>area of
obstructed and pent-up waters, which, having been set at liberty,
have left exposed the present undulated portions of the district,
of which this mound forms one of the most prominent.&nbsp; Its
present abrupt character&mdash;abrupt as compared with some of
the more shelving banks&mdash;is easily and obviously accounted
for by manifold encroachments, and by the military necessity for
making the Castle as inaccessible as possible to hostile
attacks.&nbsp; But if there is nothing in the appearance of the
Castle Hill of Oswestry that is remarkable, this cannot be said
of its history; for if there can be one fact topographically of
greater interest than another in the history of a kingdom, it is
that which is connected with the origin of its reigning
monarch.&nbsp; To say nothing, then, of the numerous battle
scenes of which Oswestry Castle has been the witness, and of
which, it might say with &AElig;neas, &lsquo;<i>Quorum pars magna
fui</i>,&rsquo; a note of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s to the
&ldquo;Monastery&rdquo; will be a sufficient warrant for saying
that Oswestry, in point of historic interest, is second to no
town in the united kingdom.&nbsp; &lsquo;The acute pen of Lord
Hailes (says the author of Waverley), which, like the spear of
Ithuriel, conjured up so many shadows from Scottish history, had
dismissed among the rest those of Banquo and Fleance, the
rejection of which fables left the illustrious family of Stewart
without an ancestor, beyond <span class="smcap">Walter</span>,
<span class="smcap">the Son of Alan</span>.&nbsp; The researches
of our late learned Antiquary detected in this Walter the
descendant of Alan, the son of Flaald, who obtained from William
the Conqueror <span class="smcap">The Castle of Oswestry</span>,
<span class="smcap">in Shropshire</span>; and who was the father
of an illustrious line of English nobles, by his first son,
William, and by his second son, Walter, the progenitor of the
royal family of Stewart.&rsquo;&nbsp; Few will be bold enough,
even if so disposed, to question the authority of such an
antiquarian as Sir Walter Scott, especially in matters relating
to his own country.&nbsp; Assuming, then, that Alan Fitz-Flaald
is the stirp of the Stewart House, a genealogical table may not
be uninteresting to the readers of this work:&mdash;</p>

179</span>&ldquo;That Sir Walter Scott is as indubitable an
authority in early English or Welsh History as in that of his own
country may not be admitted by all.&nbsp; According to the Welsh
records Oswestry belonged to Madog, Prince of Powys, who resided
at Oswestry, and built the Castle there about the year
1140.&nbsp; His second wife, Maud Vernon, an English lady of
noble birth, on the death of Madog, married William Fitz-Alan,
Lord of Clun, who in right of his wife obtained the Town and
Castle of Oswestry.&nbsp; This William was a descendant of Alan
who (says the Welsh Historian) came over with William the
Conqueror, and was the first of the Fitz-Alans that was Baron of
Oswestry.&nbsp; Again, the English historians assign to Oswestry
Castle a more ancient date than 1140.&nbsp; They inform us that
it was in being before the Norman conquest; and that Alan, a
noble Norman, had the Town and Castle bestowed upon him by the
Conqueror, soon after his accession.&nbsp; But whether Walter the
Steward was the grandson of Flaald, and of Welsh descent, or
whether his father came over from Normandy with the Conqueror, it
may be taken as a fact that Walter, the son of Alan, the younger
brother of William Fitz-Alan, went from Oswestry Castle, of which
his father was Governor, into the service of David I., King of
Scotland, as that monarch&rsquo;s Steward, and was the founder of
the house of Stewart.&nbsp; The following extract from
<i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i> is concurrent in testimony with
the main features of the above, and is fraught with additional
interest, as it shows how greatly Scotland was indebted to the
old Town of Oswestry for its progress in civilization:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;During the troublous conflicts of Maud and Stephen, in
their competition for the crown of England, Walter, the son of
Alan, the son of Flaald, fled from the family seat at Oswestry,
and settled in Scotland.&nbsp; David I. made him his Steward, and
gave him lands to support the dignity of his office.&nbsp; By the
charter we learn that these lands were those of &ldquo;Passaleth
(Paisley), Polloc, Talahee, Ketkert, le Drop, le Mutrene <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Egglesham,
Louchwinnock, and Inverwick.&rdquo;&nbsp; These estates in
Renfrewshire (then a portion of Lanarkshire) were confirmed by
Malcolm IV. in 1157, when he made the office of Steward
hereditary, and granted, in addition, various other estates in
the same quarter.&nbsp; Besides these possessions, Walter
acquired the western half of Kyle, in Ayrshire, which hence was
called Kyle Stewart.&nbsp; At this period the country was in a
semi-barbarous state; but Walter the Stewart introduced new and
civilized usages.&nbsp; He settled many of his military followers
on his lands, and, founding the Abbey of Paisley, introduced a
body of instructed men, who taught the ancient people domestic
arts and foreign manners.&nbsp; By the marriage of one of these
Stewarts with Margery Bruce, Robert the Stewart was born, and
became, 1370&ndash;1, King of Scots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hill which claims this unique and unquestionable
honour, in defiance of all the various contradictory and exploded
fables which would give it to Scotland (for no spot in England
seeks to withhold it from Oswestry), has been rescued from the
destruction with which it has long been threatened, both by the
encroachments of time and thoughtless spoliation, having been
purchased by several of the Inhabitants of Oswestry, and vested
in James Thomas Jones, Esq., as their Trustee, and is now planted
as an Arboretum.&nbsp; The panoramic view from this Hill is one
of the most beautiful scenic gems in the neighbourhood; and when
the shrubs which have been planted shall have overcome the
obstacles to their luxuriant growth, arising from exposure to
bleak winds, and a comparatively uncongenial soil, it will
constitute an ornament to the Town of Oswestry, such as few
localities can boast; and which, in addition to its historic
interest, will render it a spot, of which the Inhabitants of the
County of Salop, and of Oswestry especially, may rank among their
most remarkable objects of attraction.&nbsp; While the Hill was
being planted a small silver coin was found, which, on
examination, proved to be of the reign of David I. of
Scotland.&nbsp; <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>This, though not a direct link in the chain of proof of
the title of Oswestry Castle to the honour it claims, and defies
Scotland to dispute, is a remarkable corroborative incident, most
valuable, as circumstantial evidence, in support of the
claim.&nbsp; A stone has been placed on the Hill, with the
following inscription:&mdash;&rsquo;A.D. MCXXXVIII., Walter, son
of Alan, the progenitor of the Royal House of Stuart, left this,
his ancestral castle, in the reign of Stephen, King of England,
and of David I., King of Scots.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more recent history of the Castle may be given in a few
words.&nbsp; In the sixth of Henry II., Guy le Strange, Sheriff
of Shropshire, accounted in the exchequer for salaries paid out
of the king&rsquo;s revenues to the wardens in the Castle of
Blancminster (Oswestry), the inheritance of William Fitz-Alan,
then lately deceased.&nbsp; In the fifteenth of John, the nephew
(John) of the Earl of Pembroke, guardian of the Marches of Wales,
was made Governor of Blancminster.&nbsp; In Henry III., John
Fitz-Alan, as heir to Hugh de Albany, Earl of Arundel, had upon
the death of that Earl, assigned for his <i>purpatry</i>, the
Castle of Arundel, and upon paying &pound;1000 fine was admitted
to the possession of Oswestry Castle.&nbsp; In the twenty-fourth
of Henry III., on the death of John Fitz-Alan, John le Strange
had a grant of the custody of the lands of John, his son (then a
minor), with an allowance of 300 marks per annum, for guarding
Blancminster and other places.&nbsp; In the first of Edward I.,
John de Oxinden had the custody of the Castle of Blancminster,
upon the death of John, Earl of Arundel.&nbsp; In the third of
Edward I., Bogo de Knovil was Sheriff of the county, and Keeper
of the Castle of Blancminster.&nbsp; In the eighth of Edward I.,
Isabel, mother of Richard, Earl of Arundel, had the custody of
the Castle of Blancminster, and also of the hundred of
<i>Oswaldster</i> during the minority of her son; but two years
afterwards her brother, Edmund de Mortimer, supplanted her, and
got the grant to himself.&nbsp; In the eighteenth of Edward I.,
Adam <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>de
Montgomery died Governor of the Castle.&nbsp; In the
twenty-seventh of Edward I., Peter Meuvesine de Berwicke,
<i>juxta Akinton</i>, died in the same office.&nbsp; In the
twenty-seventh of Edward II., after the attainder of Edmund, Earl
of Arundel, Roger Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore, had a grant of the
Castle.&nbsp; In the twenty-first of Richard II., Richard, Earl
of Arundel, being attainted or executed, the king seized upon his
lands and manors, and granted them to William Scrope, Earl of
Wiltshire.&nbsp; In the seventh of Henry IV., Thomas, son of the
attainted Earl, after he was restored in blood, freed the
burgesses from many impositions of the Constable of the
Castle.&nbsp; Amongst the names of subsequent Governors of the
Castle we find those of John Trevor, Vaughan, Jeffrey Kyffyn; and
in the twenty-fifth of James I., Thomas, Earl of Suffolk, his
wife, Lord Walden, Sir Arnold Herbert, and William Herbert,
&ldquo;grant to the Lady Craven, Sir William Whitmore, George
Whitmore, and their heirs, the lordship, manor, and Castle of
Oswestry.&rdquo;&nbsp; The state of the Castle in the Civil Wars
has already been described.</p>
<p>In a record of the Inquisition, 21 Richard II., 1398,
preserved in the Tower of London, there is a curious inventory of
articles contained in Oswestry Castle on the attainder of
Richard, Earl of Arundel, taken by order of the King.&nbsp; The
Jurors consisted of inhabitants of the town and district.&nbsp;
The record states, that &ldquo;the Castle, Vill, and Lordship of
Oswaldestre, in the Marches of Wales, is worth yearly, with its
customs and appurtenances, besides the fees of all the officers
there, and besides all reprizes made there, one year with
another, &pound;252, 16s. 2d.&rdquo; * * * * &ldquo;That the said
Earl was seized as of fee of one messuage in the Vill of
Oswaldestre, by his deed enfeoffed one John ap Wyllym, to have to
him and his heirs for ever, worth yearly beyond reprizes, 6s.
8d.&nbsp; Also, that the said Earl was seized as of fee of the
advowson of the free Chapel of St. Nicholas, within the Castle of
Oswaldestre, worth 46s. 8d.&nbsp; Also, that <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the said
Earl of Arundel had within the Castle of Oswaldestre, on the 18th
day of July last past, and afterwards, the following goods and
chattels, that is to say,&mdash;in the <i>Wardrobe</i> there, 5
yew bows, 4 elm bows, 20 sheaves of arrows, 6 cross-bows, lances,
with 6 heads, 1 gun, 1 barrel of gunpowder, 200 quirells, 3
pol-axes, 2 sparthes, 3 broken jacks, 3 pair of gauntlets, 3
pallets, 1 banderich for a cross-bow, 1 table, 1 pair of stakes,
3 pair of fetters, 6 pair of iron handcuffs, with iron bolts, 1
coler, with 2 iron shakylls, 1 file, 1 hammer.&nbsp; In the
<i>Great Chamber</i>, 1 cupboard, 2 tables, 4 forms.&nbsp; In the
<i>Middle Chamber</i>, 3 chests, 2 forms, 1 table.&nbsp; In the
<i>High Chamber</i>, 1 hand-mill, panel of a certain
trefreget.&nbsp; In the <i>Constable&rsquo;s Hall</i>, 3 tables,
four tressels, 3 forms, 1 bason, with a laver, 1 small
chest.&nbsp; In the <i>Butlery</i>, 1 chest, broken at the top, 1
bucket, with an iron chain, 1 barrel for weapons, 31 keys of
different locks.&nbsp; In the <i>Chapel</i>, 1 vessel for the
holy water, 1 missal, 1 gilt chalice, 2 linen towels, with a
frontal, 2 surplices, 2 chessibles, with accompaniments, 1
hand-mill for grinding corn.&nbsp; In the <i>Kitchen</i>, 1 stone
mortar, with a pile of wood.&nbsp; In the <i>Larder</i>, 2 broken
oxheads, with 6 bushels of salt; which said artillery, arms,
goods and chattels, are put into the custody of Madog Lloid, the
Deputy of Robert Legh, Chivaler Constable of the Castle
aforesaid, for the defence of the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
enumerating several other articles, the Inquisition record adds,
&ldquo;and in a certain house in the Vill of Oswaldestre (the
said Earl possessed) 601 fleeces of wool, weighing 2 sacks, and
&#8539;th of a sack, at per sack 100s.; 50 gallons of honey, at
7s. a gallon.&nbsp; Also the said Earl had on the 18th day of
July aforesaid, and afterwards, in the said Castle, 1 white
stallion, price &pound;10; 1 race-horse, called <i>Young
Sorrell</i>, price &pound;13 6s. 8d.&nbsp; And in the Park of
Oswaldestre Superior, 16 horse colts, 13 of which are 3 years
old, and 3 of them 2 years old: price in the whole, &pound;66
13s. 4d.&rdquo;&nbsp; The record further adds, that the said
&ldquo;Earl had after the 18th of July, &pound;720 in money, and
that one Thomas Harlyng, late Receiver-General of the said Earl,
took and <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>carried away the same, whereof he is answerable to the
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; A great number of articles, with monies,
cattle, &amp;c., are stated to have been taken away by various
persons named, who are made answerable to the King for the
same.&mdash;This document is curious, inasmuch as it throws some
light upon the military weapons in use at the period, on the
plain and scanty domestic articles in the Castle, and on the low
value of farming stock, &amp;c.&nbsp; The record presents no
account of the Earl&rsquo;s apartments, or those of his servants,
or of the furniture there used.&nbsp; Probably all the valuable
property which he possessed in the fortress was carried away and
disposed of before the Earl was attainted.&nbsp; The entire
record furnishes evidence of nothing polished or luxurious; on
the contrary, it is a catalogue of mere rudeness, discomfort, and
barbarity; giving no marks whatever of vice-regal grandeur or
princely state.</p>
<p>As an additional fact it is proper to mention, that the
<i>Bailey-Head</i> was the original <i>ballium</i>, or quadrangle
of the Castle; that the mount in the Castle-field, known by the
name of the <i>Cripple-bank</i>, or <i>gathe</i>, was also the
site of the ancient <i>Barbican</i>, or outer gate, at which the
poor and diseased received relief.&nbsp; Of the free chapel,
dedicated to St. Nicholas, <i>infra Castrum de Oswaldestre</i>,
the advowson of which belonged to the Arundel family, there is
not a trace left to mark its situation.</p>
<p>The sketch of Oswestry Castle which forms one of our
illustrations shows that, in its pristine state, it was a
formidable structure, of great strength and stateliness.&nbsp;
The architecture seems to be of the Saxon order.</p>
<h4>THE WALLS.</h4>
<p>The ancient Walls of the town were the work of Edward I., and
no doubt were well and firmly built; but scarcely a vestige of
them remains.&nbsp; Their circumvallation is, however, correctly
marked in most of the old books, and old inhabitants of the
present day point out various sites on which portions of the <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>walls
stood.&nbsp; Edward was generally successful in giving strength
and endurance to his military buildings.&nbsp; Caernarvon,
Conway, and Rhuddlan Castles, all designed and erected under his
superintendence, are noble fortresses in the present age,
notwithstanding the dilapidations they have suffered from
military attack and &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s effacing
fingers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Walls of Oswestry must have suffered
much injury during the period of the Commonwealth; and perhaps
private encroachments since that time have been the principal
cause of their entire disappearance.</p>
<h3>ANCIENT HOUSES.</h3>
<p>There are still remaining several ancient timber houses, to
mark the architecture of bye-gone times.&nbsp; Among these are,
the <i>Three Tuns</i> public-house, in Bailey-Street, and an
antique edifice forming the angle of Bailey-Street and
Cross-Street, in front of which is the figure of a spread eagle,
raised on the plaster, and supposed to have been the residence of
the Lloyds, of Trenewydd, who bore the eagle in their coat of
arms.&nbsp; The <i>Three Tuns</i> was a popular house in former
days, and was the resort of most of the drapers who visited the
fairs and markets of the borough.&nbsp; Among the other old
timber buildings are Miss Holbrooke&rsquo;s, in Salop-Road, the
most attractive of any in the town, from the neatness in which it
is kept, the <i>Coach and Dogs</i>, and the <i>Fighting Cocks</i>
public-houses.&nbsp; These relics of past days may not be allowed
to remain much longer, now that improvement in the town is likely
to become so rapid in its strides.</p>
<p>The railway extension, from Oswestry to Welshpool and Newtown,
will effect important changes in most parts of the borough; and
as the antique relics to which we have been alluding are
comparatively useless in a social point of view, their sites may
soon be covered with buildings better adapted to the comforts and
requirements of the present day.</p>

186</span>ANCIENT RELICS.</h2>
<p>A ball found many years ago near the Cross in Oswestry, and
now in the possession of W. Ormsby Gore, Esq., is considered to
be one of the weights used at the end of beams in what was called
<i>Auncel Weight</i>, practised in the reign of Edward I.&nbsp;
It is ornamented with a shield, bearing the arms of England
simply, which dates it before the 15th of Edward, as in that year
he claimed the crown of France, and immediately, on obtaining it,
placed the arms of that kingdom in the first quarter of his
shield.&nbsp; On the second shield appears the bearing of the
Fitz-Alans, a lion rampant.&nbsp; The third shield has an eagle
displayed, most probably of the gentleman who at that period
filled the office of Steward.</p>
<p>Some further antiquities require a brief notice.&nbsp; The
field known by the name of <i>Croft-y-Spytty</i>, that is, <i>the
Croft of the Hospitallers</i>, intimates that the Knight
Hospitallers had once some establishment in the town.&nbsp; The
field known as <i>Erw-Spiridion</i>, <i>the Acre of Sprudion</i>,
or <i>Spiridion</i>, would lead to the conclusion that a church
or chapel, or the ground itself, had been dedicated to the
supposed Saint ycleped <i>Spiridion</i>.&nbsp; In a former part
of this volume we have referred to <i>Maes-y-garreg-llwyd</i>,
that is, <i>the Plain or Field of the Sacred Stone</i>.&nbsp;
That plain is now divided into fields, situated on the Shrewsbury
road, contiguous to Gallows-tree turnpike-gate.&nbsp; In the
field nearest to the town there stands a <span
class="smcap">Stone Pillar</span>, about seven feet in height,
and twelve in circumference; and in the field farthest from the
town, there is a similar Pillar.&nbsp; The late Rev. Peter
Roberts, the learned antiquarian, was of opinion that all the
fields at that end of the town formed a large plain when these
pillars were erected, and bore the name already mentioned, of
<i>Maes-y-garreg-llwyd</i>.&nbsp; <i>Llwyd</i> was an epithet of
the Deity, as in the expression &ldquo;<i>Duw llwyd</i>,&rdquo;
the Sacred <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Between these
two pillars there is still visible part of a ditch, called <i>the
Devil&rsquo;s Ditch</i>; and adjacent to the farthest field was
another called &ldquo;<i>Caerychain Bannog</i>,&rdquo; or <i>the
Field of </i><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span><i>the bossed Oxen</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;According to a tradition common in Wales,
these oxen were twins, and employed by <i>Hu Gadarn</i>, a hero
of antiquity, to draw a monster out of a lake, by which means he
saved the country from being inundated.&nbsp; The popular
tradition of the <i>Devil&rsquo;s Ditch</i> is, that an evil
spirit formed it, in order to convey water to deluge the country,
and that the ditch was in one night carried as far as Wynnstay,
but that when the said evil spirit had carried it so far, the
cock crew, he was obliged to desist, and it was left
unfinished.&nbsp; Absurd, however, as these traditions may
appear, they lead to the true origin, namely, that this ground
and the pillars had some reference to the Deluge, and it may
reasonably be presumed, that in the space included between these
pillars some druidical rites were performed, in commemoration of
the Deluge.&nbsp; The setting-up of a pillar, and consecrating it
to the Deity, was a memorial of reverence to <span
class="smcap">Him</span> in the time of the Patriarchs, as we
read in Genesis that Jacob set up a stone pillar, and consecrated
it, in memory of his devoting himself to the worship of the true
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And hence it may be
concluded, that these and such Pillars were in like manner the
memorials&mdash;rude indeed, but durable&mdash;of Pagan
tradition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Shrewsbury Chronicle</i> of March 16th, 1832, there
appeared the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As some workmen were digging in a field
near Oswestry, last week, they turned up the hilt and part of the
blade of an elegant antique sword.&nbsp; The blade is in two
pieces, completely encrusted with rust, and very much corroded,
but upon cleaning and grinding a part of it, the steel was found
to be of excellent temper.&nbsp; The handle is apparently of
ebony, or some similar wood, but encrusted with the oxyde which
has passed from the steel inserted in it, and worked its way
through the pores of the wood, so as to make it resemble
buck&rsquo;s horn.&nbsp; The part of the sword which is attached
to the hilt (about four inches in length) remains in the
scabbard, and, what is very remarkable, the canvass of which the
scabbard is composed is still visible.&nbsp; <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>The
scabbard and hilt are mounted with highly-chased silver, as
perfect as when it came out of the hands of the graver.&nbsp; On
the end of the hilt is an eagle, pouncing on its prey, and a
representation of Jupiter and Leda.&nbsp; On each side of the
guard is a full-length figure, and on the sides of the sword end
of the hilt are the figures of a spread eagle, and of a doe
<i>couchant regardant</i>.&nbsp; The latter appears as a
crest.&nbsp; On the silver plate which covers the opening of the
scabbard is the representation of an Arcadian Shepherd
scene.&nbsp; The sword is of the description of those which were
worn by the Cavaliers, and there can be no reasonable doubt but
that it was dropped by one of them in the route to which the
Royalist army was put by Sir Thomas Myddelton, when they made an
attempt to regain possession of Oswestry, on the 2nd of July,
1644, after its capture by the Parliament forces.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They had taken the passage of water,&rsquo; says Sir
Thomas Myddelton, &lsquo;near to Whittington, and very furiously
assaulted and charged us, but were repulsed and forced to retyre,
through the courage of our horse, who most courageously
entertained the enemy.&nbsp; Three several times the skirmish was
doubtful, either side being forced so often to retreat; but in
the end, our foot forces coming up, relieved the horse, beat back
the enemy, and pursued them with such force, that they put them
to an absolute flight, in which we pursued them five miles
towards Shrewsbury, to a place called Felton Heath, and where we
likewise remained after their flight again, masters of the
field.&nbsp; In the skirmish with the enemy, and in the pursuite
we lost several of our horse, some of our troopers, but never a
footman which I am yet informed of.&nbsp; As for the enemy, they
lost many stout men; had many of them taken prisoners, some of
them being of great quality, as the Lord Newport&rsquo;s eldest
son, and besides in their flight, such was their haste, that we
found in our pursuite, the highway as it were strewed with
ammunition, &amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; As this relic was found in the
line of this pursuit, the road having passed through the field,
there can be scarcely a doubt of its having belonged to one of
the officers of Charles&rsquo;s army.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>The
sword is in the possession of Mr. Sabine, in whose field it was
found.</p>
<p>In March, 1811, two urns were dug out of part of the Coney
Green, belonging to the late Mr. Thomas Hilditch, of
Oswestry.&nbsp; They were both of the same composition, but the
larger one of a finer and more symmetrical form.&nbsp; In the
smaller urn were found the remains of bones, but whether of the
human form could not be ascertained.</p>
<p>A piece of marble, of an oblong form, and resembling an
ancient club, was dug out of the ground at Broom Hall, in Oct.,
1836, about five feet below the surface, in a bed of clay.&nbsp;
It was one inch in thickness, but tapered to an edge all round,
the broad edge being very sharp.&nbsp; It is supposed to have
been a weapon of defence in the early British period.</p>
<h3>OSWALD&rsquo;S WELL</h3>
<p>Is one of the most interesting objects of the town.&nbsp; It
is beautifully situated to the west of the Free Grammar School,
and has easy and pleasant approaches to it from Upper
Brook-Street and from Willow-Street.&nbsp; The Well is supplied
by a spring flowing from the elevated ground beyond it.&nbsp; It
is inclosed in a small square basin, in a recess made of stone,
and arched over.&nbsp; At the back there is a sculptured head of
King Oswald, once &ldquo;banded by a royal fillet,&rdquo; and
formerly the front of the Well was secured by an iron
grate.&nbsp; Tradition and superstition have invested the Well
with much interest, but the purity of the water it sends forth
should have secured to it a far higher celebrity.&nbsp; We are
told that Oswald&rsquo;s remains were interred near the spring;
that a tree was planted there to mark the spot; that when Oswald
was slain, in the battle with Penda, an eagle tore one of the
arms from the body, and, flying off with it, fell down and
perished on the spot from which the waters burst forth, and have
continued to flow ever since, as miraculously as the waters of
St. Winifred&rsquo;s Well, in Flintshire.&nbsp; A later writer on
<a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Border
History has ventured to inform us, that so recently as the year
1780 King Oswald&rsquo;s &ldquo;skull was found in digging the
pool just below the Well.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the skull was
identified the writer does not state, probably from the great
difficulty he must have had in establishing such an important
identification.&nbsp; Setting aside all this mystification and
nonsense, we are glad to put on record, that the water from this
Well is justly entitled to the appellation of pure <i>aqua
fontana</i>; and from the analysis of Sir James Murray, which we
subjoin, its medicinal properties are of no mean
order:&mdash;&ldquo;Thermometer at 470 Fahrenheit, the water
consisting of sulphate of lime (gypsum), carbonate of lime,
muriate of soda (common salt), muriate of magnesia, and sulphate
of magnesia.&mdash;June 6th, 1822.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is generally admitted, from the records of the ancient
historical writers, that on the spot where Oswald was slain a
Monastery was founded, dedicated to him in the character of a
Saint.&nbsp; It was called <i>Blanc-Minster</i>, or the White
Monastery, and was situated according to Leland, &ldquo;on the
south side of the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; The time of the foundation
or dissolution is not known, but its situation is fixed near the
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>site of
the parish church, as some remains of the building are said to
have been discovered in digging graves in the churchyard.&nbsp; A
spot of ground near the church, still called <i>Erw-Myneich</i>,
or Monk&rsquo;s Acre, would indicate that Blanc-Minster was
contiguous to it.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII., as we have
already stated, Leland visited Oswestry, and noted that at that
period &ldquo;the cloister only was standing within the memory of
persons then living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before closing this notice we would recommend all visitors to
Oswestry to make a pilgrimage to Oswald&rsquo;s Well.&nbsp; The
scenery around it is replete with beauty; and if the day be fine
and warm, a draught of the water, which constantly bubbles up in
freshness and pellucid clearness, will cheer and not
inebriate.&nbsp; The inhabitants possess in this Well a valuable
natural treasure which it is their duty to preserve, for their
common benefit, free from all impurities and contaminations.</p>
<h2>ANCIENT CUSTOMS.</h2>
<p>In a work partly descriptive of the Border Lands of England
and Wales, it might be deemed a reproach were we silently to pass
by the customs that once prevailed in the district.&nbsp; Many of
those ancient customs were innocent and harmless in their
character, whilst others were connected with superstition which
kept the people in mental darkness, and impeded the free course
of education and knowledge.&nbsp; Our notice of these customs
will be brief, for they are no longer observed in the town, and
but slightly so, if at all, in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
printing-press has exploded such folly, and most of the ancient
customs will very soon, throughout our land, be referred to only
as evidences of the ignorance of our forefathers, and their
disregard of the educational improvement of their
fellow-creatures.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shrove Tuesday</span> and its observances
were vestiges of a Roman Carnival, when, as Aubanus tells us,
&ldquo;men eat and drank and abandoned themselves to all kinds of
foolery, as if <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>resolved to have their fill of pleasure before they
were to die.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pancake Bell&rdquo; is now
unheard, because no sexton or bell-ringer can be found to pull
the rope.&nbsp; Men and women do eat pancakes which, when well
made, even Soyer would not object to; and such gastronomy is, we
believe, the sum-total of Shrove-tide observances in the present
enlightened day.&nbsp; Cock-fighting, bull-baiting, and other
brutal amusements, formerly practised on this day, are abandoned,
we trust, for ever.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Good Friday</span> is still observed so
far, in reference to mundane things, that fathers and mothers
indulge their children with a plentiful supply of Hot Cross
Buns.&nbsp; This observance is harmless enough.&nbsp; The day
being the anniversary of our Saviour&rsquo;s Crucifixion, it is
now marked by the entire Christian community as one of solemn
worship; and as time rolls on, and religious education prevails,
we may reasonably expect that a still more devotional regard will
be paid to this day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Easter-Day</span> is no longer observed by
people walking into the fields early in the morning to see the
&ldquo;sun come dancing from the east.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
<i>Heaving</i> or <i>Lifting</i> system, formerly much practised
on Easter Monday and Tuesday, is now rapidly on the wane.&nbsp;
By men and women not remarkable for their love of decency or
modesty, it is still partially observed in Oswestry.&nbsp; The
custom would, however, be &ldquo;more honoured in the breach than
the observance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All Fools&rsquo; Day</span> (April 1) is,
we believe, acknowledged by many of that class who are fond of a
joke.&nbsp; The wit formerly displayed on this day consisted in
sending persons on what are called sleeveless errands, for the
history of Eve&rsquo;s mother, for pigeon&rsquo;s milk, and in
quest of other absurdities.&nbsp; In the present day rude tricks
are tried even upon philosophers, and with much gusto when they
succeed.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Verdant Greens,&rdquo; at this season
of the year, are especially full-blown.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span><span
class="smcap">May-Day</span> formerly brought with it flowery
decorations in front of our house-doors; but this pretty custom
has long since faded away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Walking the Boundaries</span>.&mdash;A
general custom formerly, but observed now in very few
places.&nbsp; The Mayor, Churchwardens, Overseers, &amp;c., of
Oswestry walked the boundaries in 1813, and that was the last
occasion of this ancient observance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Palm Sunday</span>, <span
class="smcap">Maundy Thursday</span>, <span class="smcap">Royal
Oak Day</span>, <span class="smcap">Corpus Christi Day</span>,
<span class="smcap">Oswestry Wake</span>, <span class="smcap">All
Saints&rsquo; Eve</span>, <span class="smcap">St. Swithin&rsquo;s
Day</span>, &amp;c., have become, so far as rude observances are
concerned, mere relics of past days.&nbsp; Our ancestors marked
all these days with scrupulous attention; but few if any men of
the present time have boldness enough to set them apart for
rejoicing and merriment&mdash;for feast and carnival&mdash;as in
days of yore.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Gunpowder Plot</span>
(Nov. 5) is occasionally noticed by boys, discharging pop-guns,
and alarming the lieges with bonfires, effigies, squibs and
crackers; but that absurd and bigoted observance is in its
downward course, no one being interested in its continuance at
present but the pyrotechnists, who tempt boys to spend their
money in rockets, blue-lights, and other combustibles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Christmas</span>.&mdash;Some twenty years
ago Christmas morn was ushered in with the singing of carols by
&ldquo;wakeful Waits,&rdquo; thus joyfully celebrating the
opening of this truly-festive anniversary, and this custom is
still partially observed.&nbsp; The singers of the Parish Church
also greeted the inhabitants at their several dwellings with
sounds of grateful melody.&nbsp; No longer is this latter custom
maintained, but <span class="smcap">Christmas Day</span> is
marked as a sacred and solemn festival; &ldquo;the rich and the
poor meet together;&rdquo; on that day the conventionalities of
rank and dignity are thrown aside; hospitality prevails in every
house in the land, from the palace to the <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>cottage;
families are collected together to partake of that day&rsquo;s
joyful festivity; and the nation at large presents the delightful
picture of one happy family.&nbsp; The rich administer kindly to
the poor, and all hearts are touched with benevolence or
gratitude.&nbsp; Long may our merry Christmas-tides thus be
observed; for such customs are based on true religion, which
teaches men &ldquo;to love one another.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Railway Communication.</h2>
<p>We need not enter into detail, now-a-days, to show how railway
communication was rendered necessary a quarter of a century ago
by the great increase of travelling throughout the land, and the
insufficiency as well as inefficiency of stagecoach conveyance to
satisfy the public wants.&nbsp; When railway travelling was first
suggested stage-coaches had been &ldquo;whipped-up&rdquo; by
&ldquo;coming events&rdquo; into improvement; the people were no
longer compelled to &ldquo;drag their slow length along,&rdquo;
for full five wearisome days, from Chester to London.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Gee-hos,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Highflyers,&rdquo; at four
miles an hour; &ldquo;The Birmingham and Shrewsbury Long Coach,
with six able horses, in four days;&rdquo; even the &ldquo;Flying
Machine,&rdquo; from Shrewsbury to London in two days, had all
passed the <i>stage</i> of their creeping existence; and the
liege subjects of the realm were now beginning to be whirled
along, at ten and twelve miles an hour, in
&ldquo;Quicksilvers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tantivys,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Erin-go-braghs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tallyhos,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wonders,&rdquo; and other well-horsed and well-appointed
vehicles bearing equally excitable names.&nbsp; The Coach called
&ldquo;The Wonder&rdquo; made the journey from Shrewsbury to
London in a day.&nbsp; An intelligent contributor
writes,&mdash;&ldquo;The late old Justice Smith, in a
conversation I had with him some 25 years ago, said, &lsquo;I
remember going to London 70 years ago by a coach called The Fly;
we were 7 nights and 8 days on the road, and now they go in a
day&mdash;what a man lives to see!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
even this increased &ldquo;pace&rdquo; did not meet the
requirements of the community.&nbsp; James Watts&rsquo;
steam-engine had begun to revolutionize all classes <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>and
occupations.&nbsp; In manufactures, hand-looms, spinning-jennies,
shuttles, treddles, and the rest of early inventions were
superseded by steam-power, moving machinery for spinning and
weaving; in packet and marine conveyance generally Watts&rsquo;
steam-power wrought as great a change; and in the manufacture of
metal and porcelain goods, the sawing of timber and stone, and
even the making of pins and needles, steam was the great giant
power.&nbsp; With this national revolution in trade,
manufactures, and commerce, came a more active and enterprising
spirit among the people; soft and hard goods, as the manufactures
of the north and midland counties are technically called, were
multiplied until supply exceeded demand; the locomotive wants and
desires of the public increased; and all eyes and heads were
turned towards Watts&rsquo; steam-engine as the only mighty agent
of accelerated travelling.&nbsp; The history of the country has
supplied the results of this great experiment.&nbsp; The
ever-honoured George Stephenson succeeded in carrying
heavily-laden trains, of passengers and goods, on the Liverpool
and Manchester Railway, at the rate of thirty miles an hour; and
in the present day such is the appetite for rapid railway
locomotion, that express trains, as they are called, flying over
the earth at a more than race-horse speed of forty miles an hour,
will scarcely satisfy the urgent requirements of manufactures and
commerce.</p>
<p>Railway projects arose in various parts of the kingdom, and
the first step taken towards what has since proved a direct
communication with this borough and the metropolis was the
incorporation of the <i>Great Western Railway Company</i>, by an
Act passed in 5 and 6 of William IV.&nbsp; Some years elapsed
before any measures were adopted to establish railway
communication in this district.&nbsp; At length, in 1845, when
railway &ldquo;bubbles and squeaks&rdquo; &ldquo;affrighted the
isle from its propriety,&rdquo; a direct line was projected from
Chester, through Whitchurch and Wem, to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The
scheme <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>was promoted by the Chester and Holyhead Railway
Company, the London and Birmingham, and other important
interests.&nbsp; Mr. Robert Stephenson was appointed engineer,
and Mr. Mallaby, of Liverpool, solicitor.&nbsp; A Company, called
the &ldquo;North Wales Mineral Railway Company,&rdquo; had
previously obtained an Act for making a line of Railway, from
Chester to Rhuabon, and on the scheme for the line from the
former place, <i>via</i> Whitchurch and Wem, being announced, a
Company, in friendly connection with the North Wales Mineral
Railway Company, and called the Shrewsbury, Oswestry, and Chester
Junction Railway Company, was formed for the purpose of extending
the Railway from Rhuabon to Shrewsbury, in opposition to the
other scheme mentioned above.&nbsp; The late Mr. Henry Kelsall,
of Chester, was appointed solicitor, and Mr. Robertson
engineer.&nbsp; A sharp struggle between the rival Companies
ensued, but at length the line from Chester to Shrewsbury,
<i>via</i> Whitchurch and Wem, was abandoned; by the prudent
interposition of Mr. Edward Williams, solicitor, of Oswestry, (of
the firm of &ldquo;Longueville and Williams,&rdquo;) the
dissentient landowners were appeased; and the &ldquo;Shrewsbury,
Oswestry, and Chester Junction Railway Company&rdquo; obtained
their Act, which passed through parliament as an unopposed Bill,
the royal assent being given to it the 30th of June, 1845.&nbsp;
W. Ormsby Gore, Esq., as Chairman of the successful line,
rendered powerful assistance to its claims, having clearly seen
the advantages which it must render to the important interests of
North Shropshire.&nbsp; The next step was to unite the two lines
between Chester and Shrewsbury, viz., the North Wales Mineral
Railway, and the Shrewsbury, Oswestry, and Chester Junction, and
an arrangement was accordingly entered into by the two Companies,
by which, in 1846, they were united into one, under the title of
&ldquo;The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway Company.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The subsequent history of this line is patent to the public; the
battles of the Great Western Railway interest, with those of <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the North
Western, each Company seeking to possess the line, almost
rivalling in intensity the fierce struggles of the ancient
Roses&mdash;York and Lancaster.&nbsp; In the Parliamentary
Session of 1854 a Bill was brought into the House of Commons by
Viscount Barrington, Lord Norreys, and Sir Phillip Egerton, to
authorize the consolidation, into one Company, of the Great
Western, the Shrewsbury and Birmingham, and the Shrewsbury and
Chester Railways.&nbsp; The Bill was sanctioned by Parliament,
and the Act is now cited for all purposes under the title of
&ldquo;The Great Western, Birmingham, and Chester Railway
Section.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this consolidation of these several
Companies a direct communication with London, under one system of
Railway management, has been secured to the town of Oswestry; the
journey by the <i>Express Trains</i> occupying no more than about
five and a half hours.&nbsp; The country through which the
<i>Great Western</i> line runs is remarkable for its beauty and
interest.&nbsp; Windsor Castle, Oxford, Blenheim, Leamington,
Warwick, and other attractive places, are in close proximity; and
to add to these advantages, the care, attention, and able
management of the entire line, are further agreeable features in
the route, which all travellers on the railway gratefully
acknowledge.</p>
<p>To the inhabitants of Oswestry and its vicinity it is
unnecessary to say anything in praise of the attractive scenery
that gives such lively interest to the railway between Shrewsbury
and Chester.&nbsp; To the stranger, however, and the summer
tourist in search of the sublime and picturesque, we may remark,
that few lines in the kingdom present so many charms to the
admiring gaze as this most delightful railway.&nbsp; Llangollen
Vale has a world-wide celebrity; whilst the Chirk Viaduct,
spanning the Ceiriog Vale; the pretty village of Chirk; Lord
Dungannon&rsquo;s pleasant seat at Brynkinalt; &ldquo;Chirk
Castle walls;&rdquo; Wynnstay Park; the fine tower of Wrexham
Church; Gresford Vale, with its luxuriant and refreshing scenery;
and the graceful approach to Chester, across &ldquo;Sweet <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Deva&rsquo;s wizard stream,&rdquo; and in sight of the
animating race-course (the Roodeye), the fine old Roman walls of
the city, the ancient Castle, a work of Roman art, the Armoury,
county Gaol, St. Werburgh&rsquo;s Cathedral, the venerable Church
and Priory of St. John the Baptist,&mdash;these, with many other
relics of days now</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Numbered with those beyond the
flood,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>must give an intense interest to those who value objects
stamped with natural beauty and hoary antiquity.</p>
<p>All hostility between the Great Western and North Western
Railway Companies having, at least for the present, ceased, both
of these gigantic undertakings can, without ungenerous feelings
one against the other, devote their energies and capital to the
improvement of all departments of their respective undertakings,
rendering to the public the attention, comfort, and assurance of
safety in travelling which railway management ought to
secure.</p>
<h3>EXTENSION LINE FROM OSWESTRY TO WELSHPOOL AND NEWTOWN.</h3>
<p>Whilst this volume was passing through the press a successful
effort was made in carrying through Parliament a Bill for
extending a line of railway through part of Montgomeryshire,
commencing by a junction with the Shrewsbury and Chester Section
of the Great Western Railway.&nbsp; The Bill was introduced into
the House of Commons in the early part of the present Session of
Parliament (1855), and passed through the various stages of that
branch of the Legislature without opposition.&nbsp; In the House
of Lords a slight but unsuccessful opposition was raised, and the
Bill received the Royal assent on the 25th of June.&nbsp; Thus
has been secured to the county of Montgomery, which is rapidly
growing in population and importance, the advantage of railway
communication <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>direct from the metropolis, and from the busy seats of
manufacturing industry in the north.&nbsp; The manufacturing and
agricultural wealth and enterprise of Montgomeryshire, its rich
mineral resources, and the benefits which will accrue to it by
throwing open to its use the affluent coal-fields of Shropshire
and Denbighshire, were strong claims entitling Montgomeryshire to
the boon she sought.&nbsp; The further objects contemplated by
the promoters of this line, in connecting it, at no far distant
period, with the magnificent national harbour at Milford Haven,
and thus opening a grand route from that capacious landing-place
from the north of Ireland to Manchester, Yorkshire, and the
Midland Counties, were doubtless among the considerations of
Parliament in granting their sanction to this railway.&nbsp; The
line will commence by a junction with the Shrewsbury and Chester
section of the Great Western Railway, at its Oswestry terminus,
and then proceed by Llanymynech, Llandrinio, Llandisilio, and
Buttington, to Welshpool; thence, crossing the river Severn, near
Miltrewydd, will pass between Montgomery and Berriew, and on to
Newtown, on the south side of the river, where it will unite with
the Newtown and Llanidloes line.</p>
<p>The capital authorized to be raised by the &ldquo;Oswestry and
Newtown Railway Company&rdquo; is &pound;250,000.&nbsp; Mr.
Benjamin Piercy is appointed resident engineer of the line; and
Mr. Peter Barlow consulting engineer.&nbsp; The contractors for
the making of the entire line are Messrs. M&rsquo;Cormick and
Thornton, whose previous railway contracts give the best
assurance that the present line will be constructed in an
efficient manner.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first general meeting of the shareholders was held at the
Town Hall, Welshpool, on Saturday, July 21st; <span
class="smcap">William Ormsby Gore</span>, Esq., Chairman of the
Board of Provisional Directors, in the chair.&nbsp; The
attendance was very numerous.&nbsp; <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>The report stated that it was the
intention of the Directors to proceed with the construction of
the railway with as little delay as possible, that the
certificates of the proprietorship of the shares in the capital
of the Company, under the seal of the Company, could be forthwith
issued to the Shareholders; that the Directors congratulated the
Shareholders and the district upon the unanimity which had
prevailed in the establishment and progress of the Company, and
expressed their hope that this would lead to the speedy
completion of the undertaking, and the further developement of
the resources of the country.&nbsp; The speakers on this occasion
were the Chairman, Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart. M.P., the Rev. C. T. C.
Luxmoore, the Ven. Archdeacon Clive, G. H. Whalley, Esq., the
Rev. Maurice Lloyd, Richard Humphreys, Esq., George Brace, Esq.,
and other gentlemen.&nbsp; The Directors named in the Act were,
William Ormsby Gore, Esq., M.P., Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Bart.
M.P., D. Pugh, Esq. M.P., John Naylor, Esq., John Carnac Morris,
Esq., Richard Herbert Mytton, Esq., John Davies Corrie, Esq.,
Rowland Jones Venables, Esq., Arthur James Johnes, Esq., Col.
Herbert Watkin Williams Wynn, M.P., J. Powell Wilding, Esq., and
Wm. Lloyd, Esq., and they were re-elected unanimously.&nbsp; An
important resolution was also passed, &ldquo;That it is the
opinion of this meeting, that it is of the utmost importance to
the interest of the Company that a communication by railway
should be effected between Newtown and Milford Haven; and the
Directors are hereby requested to afford such co-operation and
assistance to any Companies now existing, or which may be
projected, as would best tend to accomplish that
object.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entire proceedings were marked by
harmony and good spirit, and all present appeared suitably
impressed with the importance and value of railway communication
through Montgomeryshire, and with the benefits, in connection
with the great national harbour at Milford Haven, which would
ultimately accrue to the &ldquo;Oswestry and Newtown Railway
Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Few, if <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>any, railway enterprizes were ever
started under a more able and upright management, and perhaps
equally few lines, of so short a distance, had at their outset
such encouraging prospects before them.&nbsp; With these signal
advantages no doubt can be entertained that the undertaking will
be crowned with abundant success.</p>

<h3>POPULATION.</h3>
<p>The population of the town and parish, in 1801, amounted to
5,839; and the number of houses, 788.&nbsp; In 1811 the
population of the town and parish had increased to 6,733.&nbsp;
In 1821 the returns showed that the population of the town and
parish was still on the increase, the number of males and females
being 7,523.&nbsp; The population of the town and liberties, in
June, 1831, was&mdash;males, 2,007; females, 2,471; total,
4,478.&nbsp; The return further showed that the number of houses
in course of being built, was 3; houses uninhabited, 29; ditto
inhabited, 885; families engaged in agriculture, 11; in trade,

<h2>Natural History.</h2>
<p>Our limits will not admit of extended observation on this
subject, but it is our duty to direct the attention of our
readers to the feathered tribes in the district, which include
many of the more remarkable and beautiful of British birds.&nbsp;
Mr. Cross, of Oswestry, has, in the last few years, made

songsters, including the nightingale, the piping bullfinch, with
birds of prey, those of the passerine order, and a large variety
of water birds.&nbsp; The following list, formed more than twenty

209</span>ANGLING.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Oswestry</span> has no rivers immediately
contiguous to it, but at short and easily-approachable distances
are several, namely, the <i>Severn</i>, the <i>Vyrnwy</i>, the
<i>Tanat</i>, the <i>Dee</i>, the <i>Ceiriog</i>, the
<i>Perry</i>, the <i>Morlas</i>, and the <i>Morda</i>.&nbsp; The
Severn has its rise from a small lake, on the eastern side of
Plinlimmon, whence it flows in a devious direction, under the
Welsh name of <i>Hafren</i>, to Newtown, whence it assumes its
English name of Severn, and pursues its circuitous route to
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; From its source to fair Salopia it runs nearly
one hundred miles, receiving the waters of several
tributaries.&nbsp; From Shrewsbury it continues its winding
course, and receives the Tern, at the foot of the Wrekin, about
which it describes a semi-circle; then curving repeatedly, it
flows towards Coalbrookdale, whence it flows in a north-west
direction to Tewksbury, and eventually to the British
Channel.&nbsp; Blakey, in his recently-published volume on
&ldquo;Angling,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The best bottom-fishing for
carp, perch, roach, chub, and eel, is within those portions of
the river appropriated to navigation.&nbsp; Grayling are to be
met with in many parts of the Severn.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Vyrnwy and
Tanat abound with fish; the former so much so that it has
obtained the title of <i>Piscosus Amnis</i>.&nbsp; The Tanat
falls into the Vyrnwy at Aber-Tanat, and the Vyrnwy into the
Severn at a place called <i>Y Cymmerau</i> (the Conflux), at the
lower end of Guilsfield <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>parish, not far distant from the
Breiddin, Moel y Golfa, and Cefn y Castell mountains.&nbsp; The
scene in this district has been sung in rapturous and beautiful
strains by a Welsh bard and warrior, of the 12th century
(Gwalchmai):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rise orb of day! the eastern gates
unfold,<br />
And shew thy crimson mantle, fring&rsquo;d with gold;<br />
Contending birds sing sweet on every spray,<br />
The skies are bright&mdash;arise, thou orb of day!<br />
I, Gwalchmai, call&mdash;in song, in war renown&rsquo;d,<br />
Who, lion-like, confusion spread around,&mdash;<br />
The live-long night the Hero and the Bard,<br />
Near Breiddin&rsquo;s rocks, have left a constant guard,<br />
Where cool transparent streams in murmurs glide,<br />
And springing grass adorns the mountain&rsquo;s side,<br />
Where snow-white sea-mews in the current play,<br />
Spread their gay plumes, and frolic through the day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blakey furnishes some practical information on this branch of
our notice.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Vyrnwy has a great number of dependent
feeders, the principal of which are the <i>Eunant</i>, the
<i>Afon</i>, the <i>Gedis</i>, the <i>Afon Gynnan</i>, the
<i>Glasgwn</i>, and the <i>Cown</i>.&nbsp; These undoubtedly
constitute a considerable range of the waters, and are well
adapted for the fly, and some for trolling as well.&nbsp; After
the main river receives all these tributaries, it flows a
south-eastern course for twenty miles, and then receives the
waters of the <i>Twrch</i>, which flows a distance of twenty
miles, through a very interesting section of the country.&nbsp;
This tributary itself has good angling feeders, capable of
affording fair sport with the rod.&nbsp; The Vyrnwy likewise
receives the <i>Cain</i>, and, a little farther down, the
<i>Tanat</i>, both of which contain good fish.&nbsp; The Tanat
itself is fed by several good streams, as the <i>Rhaiadr</i>, the
<i>Afon Harrog</i>, and the <i>Ymrch</i>.&nbsp; Here there is
good fly-fishing.&nbsp; All these waters, large and small, are
bright, sparkling, and flowing, and have that peculiar form of
stream which indicates good sport.&nbsp; As to the colour of the
fly requisite in these mountain streams, little need be said; in
fact, when the fish <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>are in humour, and they are not here
capricious, they seem to snatch at anything in the shape of an
insect.&nbsp; Very large flies, however, will not answer
well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Dee</i> has its origin in Merionethshire, by the
junction of two small streams rising about four miles to the
north-west of Llanwchllyn, and two miles below that village
enters Pimblemere, or Bala Lake (Llyn Tegid); issuing from that,
beneath Bala, it flows under the bridge, takes a north-easterly
direction through the Vale of Eideirnion, and turning to the east
in fine meandering curves, waters the Vales of Glyndwrdwy (Vale
of the Dee), and Llangollen, where it receives the tributary
Br&acirc;n.&nbsp; Thence, passing through Llangollen Vale,
beneath Pont-y-cysyllte Aqueduct, and the Great Western
(Shrewsbury and Chester) Viaduct, both of which span the Vale, it
curves below Wynnstay Park, emerges into the Vale Royal of
Cheshire, and finally, after passing through Holt, and skirting
Eaton Hall, the magnificent seat of the Marquis of Westminster,
glides past the Church of St. John the Baptist, in Chester,
beneath the ancient and new bridges and railway viaduct there,
and finally, at the estuary of the Dee, enters St. George&rsquo;s
Channel.&nbsp; The portion of the Dee running through
Denbighshire and Flintshire (not far distant from Oswestry,) is
an excellent locality for trout-fishing, as the well-supplied
dinner-tables of the two hotels in Llangollen (the <i>Hand</i>
and the <i>Victoria</i>) can amply testify.&nbsp; The Ceiriog,
the Perry, the Morlas, and the Morda, are each well stored with
fish, and can supply the angler with tempting rewards for his
patience and skill.&nbsp; The <i>Lake of Llynclys</i>, near
Oswestry, has not only a poetical, but a piscatory celebrity
also.&nbsp; It is the scene of a clever ballad, from the pen of
the poet Dovaston, who, as a prefix to his metrical tale, has
given the following description of the Lake:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Llynclys Pool</i> is a small but
beautiful lake, of extraordinary depth, on the Welsh border, near
Oswestry.&nbsp; The name in the Welsh signifies <i>Sunk
Palace</i>, and the vulgar have a firmly-believed <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>superstition (in which the neighbourhood abounds),
corresponding with the catastrophe of this ballad; nay, some even
at this day go so far as to affirm, that when the water is clear
and the surface smooth, towers and chimneys may be seen in it at
a great depth.&nbsp; In the summer months fishing parties of
ladies and gentlemen frequently spend the day on it in a boat
with music and refreshments; on one of these occasions this
ballad was hastily written.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lake is situated near the turnpike-road from Oswestry to
Welshpool, only a short distance from Llynclys
turnpike-gate.&nbsp; It is bordered on some of its sides with
reeds and rushes, and a few years ago the flower of a white water
lily was pulled up, not far from the shore, the stalk of which
measured nearly fourteen feet.&nbsp; The fishery is the property
of the Earl of Powis, and the water abounds with pike, bream,
perch, and dace.&nbsp; R. H. Kinchant, Esq., of Park Hall, near
Oswestry, has also an interest in the fishery.</p>
<p>The <i>Ceiriog</i>, a picturesque and romantic river, winds
among the rocks behind Oswestry, forming deep glens and dingles,
and falls into the Dee below Chirk.&nbsp; The <i>Perry</i> and
<i>Morlas</i> are two bright rivulets arising in the mountains
near Selattyn; the former passes Whittington and falls into the
Severn, near Fitz, whilst the latter unites with the Ceiriog,
near Pont-y-blew.&nbsp; The <i>Morda</i>, no inconsiderable
stream, finds its rapid way between the rocks at Llanforda,
immediately above the town of Oswestry, and, sweeping its course
to the south, falls into the Vyrnwy at Pentreheylin.</p>
<p>The following metrical instructions to the student angler,
although the lines are quaint, may not be deficient of interest
to the younger disciples of Isaac Walton:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In deep the silver <i>Salmon</i> loves to
rove;<br />
And marly swifts allure the <i>Barbel</i> drove;<br />
Sharp streams delight the <i>Trout</i>, still deep the
<i>Bream</i>;<br />
The fearful <i>Chub</i>, he loves the shaded stream.<br />
In shady holes and hollow banks, the <i>Perch</i> he dwells,<br
/>
<a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>And, for
his boldness, the finny race excels;<br />
<i>Roach</i> and <i>Dace</i> the sandy bottom choose,<br />
And <i>Carp</i> the weeds, and <i>Tench</i> the muddy ooze.<br />
In streams with gravel bottom <i>Gudgeons</i> do delight,<br />
The wanton <i>Bleak</i> will ever sport in sight;<br />
The <i>Pike</i>, the tyrant of the finny brood,<br />
Near weeds and ledge lies lurking for his food.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Botany of the Parish.</h3>
<p>We are indebted to the <span class="smcap">Rev. Thomas
Salwey</span>, Vicar of Oswestry, for the subjoined interesting
paper on the Botany of the Parish.&nbsp; It gives evidence of his
ardent attachment to this pleasing branch of Natural History, and
its publication may lead others to follow his example, in
studying a science which delightfully leads the mind of its
possessor to an increased admiration of the beauty and wisdom of
the Creator&rsquo;s marvellous works:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By cooling streams and softening showers<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vegetable race are fed;<br />
And trees and plants, and herbs and flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their Maker&rsquo;s bounty smiling spread.</p>
<p>The flowing tribes all blooming rise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the faint attempts of art;<br />
Their bright inimitable dyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak sweet conviction to the heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The interest and variety of the Botanical productions
of any district will always be found to depend upon its
geological character; and in this respect there are perhaps few
Parishes which comprise within their boundaries so many different
geological formations as that of Oswestry.&nbsp; The lower part
of the Parish, from the neighbourhood of the Town to the
Queen&rsquo;s Head, consists of the new red sandstone; or rather
to that part of it which is called by modern Geologists the
Permian formation, and which is so called because this formation
is most amply developed in the District of Perm, in Russia.&nbsp;
The Town itself is situated upon the coal-measures.&nbsp; With
this is associated the usual sandstone grit and <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>chert,
breaking out in Sweeney Mountain and Mynydd-y-Myfyr.&nbsp;
Immediately at the back of these hills the mountain, or
carboniferous limestone, breaks out, running in a line through
the parish from Cynynion, through Pentregaer, Trefonen, and
Treflach, to Porth-y-waen.&nbsp; This is here and there broken
through by detached masses of Trap Rock, as at the point on which
the Tower of Pentregaer is built, and upon the western slope of
the Moelydd; whilst on the slope of the hill from Cynynion, and
under Coed-y-Coch, the Silurian system begins to shew
itself.&nbsp; In such a district we may reasonably expect a
corresponding variety of plants.&nbsp; In the following list,
however, it is by no means intended to give anything like a
complete enumeration of the plants to be found within the
district, which would be inconsistent with such a publication as
the present.&nbsp; Such plants only have been selected as will
show the character of the Botany, and be a sufficient guide to
any Botanist in conducting his researches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, however, as is the variety of Geological
formation within the Parish, there is one feature, always of the
greatest interest to the Botanist, which unfortunately it does
not possess, namely, old woods, with their ancient oaks, the
growth of centuries, and the deep mossy dells which are so
favourable to the production of the scarcer cryptogamic
plants.&nbsp; We have no scenery of this kind in our Parish, or
even in the immediate neighbourhood, and hence our mosses are
only those which are found everywhere.&nbsp; The beautiful little
<i>Dicranum bryoides</i> (the moss which so revived the spirit of
the unfortunate Mungo Park when fainting in the deserts of
Africa), may indeed be found in Broom Hall lane; and the
<i>Hypnum commutation</i> may be gathered at the foot of the
Moelydd.&nbsp; The <i>Bryum palustre</i> may also be found above
Morda pool; and the <i>Bryum roseum</i>, and the large and
handsome <i>Bryum ligulatum</i>, in some of the wet and shady
lanes in the upper part of the Parish; but beyond these I am not
aware that there are any mosses of peculiar interest to be found
amongst us.&nbsp; We have, however, a greater variety of <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>ferns than
perhaps any other district of equal extent could produce; but
here again only the more scarce ones are enumerated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more minute cryptogamic plants, and especially
those under the head of <i>Fungi</i>, will of course be the least
interesting portion of the list; but any notice of the Botany of
the district would be incomplete without the introduction of a
proportionate number of these obscure, but, to a Botanist,
highly-interesting plants.</p>

found in the parish, or close to its immediate

<h3>Geology, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>The town of Oswestry is situated upon and near the southern
termination of the North Wales Coal Field, which extends a little
farther south of the town, and, north-west, through Ruabon,
Brymbo, Flint, Mostyn, and on to the sea, near the Great
Ormshead.&nbsp; Running parallel, and lying at the back, or to
the west of these coal-measures, is the great belt of mountain
limestone, commencing at Llanymynech Hill, and extending also,
north-westerly, to the Ormshead, and from thence dipping into the
sea.</p>
<p>The metalliferous character of the district is distinguished
for the production of lead, copper, and zinc.&nbsp; Trials have
been made for minerals at Treflach Wood, and portions of
carbonate and sulphuret of copper, of average qualities, have
been found, but not in sufficient quantities to justify extended
operations.&nbsp; At Llanymynech Hill both copper and lead,
sulphurets and carbonates, with carbonate of zinc, or calamine,
have been raised in large quantities by various companies, and
occasionally the ores have reached a high per centage, ranging
from five to twenty-five per cent.&nbsp; The ores are found in
beds or flats, at from thirty to fifty yards from the surface,
and lying between, and running parallel with, the strata of
limestone that inclose them.&nbsp; It is an extraordinary fact,
that the metalliferous belt of limestone abruptly terminates at
the south end of the hill, and cannot be traced farther.&nbsp;
Proceeding west, at the back of Oswestry, in Treflach Wood, there
are some fine beds of Derbyshire marble or entrochal limestone,
that have been worked for mantle-pieces and other ornamental
purposes.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>Trials have been made, and small quantities of lead and
copper found in this limestone belt, extending to Minera,
including the Eglwyseg range which bounds a portion of the Vale
of Llangollen, near to Ruabon.</p>
<p>The Minera district is too well known for its rich mineral
products, especially of lead and zinc, to require particular
notice, and the same may be said of the Mold, Halkin, and
Holywell mineral formation, passing on with continued fine
mineral deposits, to Talargoch, near Prestatyn, in
Flintshire.</p>
<p>The coal-measures in the district of Oswestry abound in
fossils, <i>Lepidodendrons</i>, <i>Sigillaria</i>,
<i>Stigmaria</i>, and <i>Calamites</i>, &amp;c.; and the
carboniferous limestone is much more prolific of that class of
fossiliferous productions which usually accompany the old
mountain limestone.</p>
<p>The application of capital and scientific labour to mining
operations, during the last ten years, has given to the district
an active and business-like character, and brought with it a
large increase to the working population.&nbsp; At Llanymynech
Hill, in addition to mining operations, there are annually raised
about 60,000 tons of limestone, which is chiefly used for farming
purposes in Montgomeryshire and Shropshire.&nbsp; At Porth-y-Waen
rocks, in the same range, there is nearly the same quantity of
limestone raised.&nbsp; The united quantities hewn and blasted
from these vast limestone rocks produce about 70,000 tons of
burnt lime, thus showing the extended use now made of limestone
in the cultivation of farm lands in the immediate district.</p>
<p>The manufacture of iron is most extensively carried on in
Ruabon parish, principally by the New British Iron Company, the
quantity of good bar iron made amounting on the average to 350
tons per week.&nbsp; These works give employment to about 2,500
people, men and boys.&nbsp; The Company works its own collieries,
and consumes nearly all the coal its <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>numerous pits produce.&nbsp; In the
same parish there are two extensive manufactories, for the
conversion of the ores of calamine and black jack (carbonate and
sulphuret of zinc) into zinc or spelter, and at each of these
places from twenty to thirty tons of these metals are made.</p>
<p>The coals raised from the coal-fields in and around Oswestry,
worked by Messrs. Croxon and others, amount to about 40,000 tons
per annum; whilst nearly 250,000 tons are raised in the Ruabon
district, and a much larger quantity at Brymbo.</p>
<p>At Minera a powerful Company is actively engaged in working
the old mines that produced so much ore during the former
operations upon them.&nbsp; These mines were closed from the
influx of water, and the inadequacy of the machinery then
employed to carry it off.&nbsp; The present Company have, with an
enterprising spirit, adopted the highest class of machinery, and
employed the best mining talent that could be procured.&nbsp; By
these means, which have called forth the application of at least
&pound;50,000 to this gigantic undertaking, the Company has
fortunately succeeded in discovering rich veins of lead-ore,
which produce from 100 to 150 tons per month.&nbsp; Other mining
companies are also largely engaged in the district, some of which
are producing large quantities of lead-ore.</p>
<h2>Biography.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Oswestry</span>, although not the
birth-place of many distinguished men, has amongst its present
population some &ldquo;choice spirits,&rdquo; men born not,
perhaps, to wield &ldquo;the fierce democracy,&rdquo; or to
attract the nation&rsquo;s glare by the display of brilliant
talents, yet who possess the happy art of imparting sterling
benefits to their fellow-men, and scattering blessings all around
them.&nbsp; We could point to gentlemen, still honourably
connected with the borough, whose good names must be
well-deserved, because they have been earned among their <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>fellow-citizens.&nbsp; The borough has nevertheless
extended education to several eminent characters, and been the
chosen residence of many others.&nbsp; The names of Kenyon,
Charles W. W. Wynn, West, Parker, Longueville, Lloyd, Donne, and
Dovaston, are still cherished with grateful recollections, their
talents and labours having been ably exercised for the social
benefit and intellectual advancement of the town.</p>
<p>We subjoin a few sketches of worthies that did the
&ldquo;State some service,&rdquo; and whose connection with
Oswestry claims for them a notice in these pages:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thomas Bray</span>, an eminently pious
and learned divine of the 17th century, was educated in
Oswestry.&nbsp; He was afterwards entered of Hart Hall, Oxford,
took his degree of Master of Arts there, was chosen by Dr.
Compton, Bishop of London, to model the infant church at
Maryland, and afterwards took the degree of Doctor in
Divinity.&nbsp; He returned from Maryland, after a long and
useful residence there, and rendered immense service to the cause
of foreign missions, by his numerous publications and remarkable
personal exertions.&nbsp; He closed a useful life in 1730, having
reached the age of seventy-three years.&nbsp; He was born at
Marton, in Salop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">John Freeman Milward Dovaston</span>,
M.A.&mdash;The death of this sweet poet, accomplished musician,
and profound naturalist, occurred in August, 1854.&nbsp; Mr.
Dovaston was not a native of Oswestry, but his birth-place
(Westfelton) being so near to the borough, and his social
connexion with it so constant and intimate during the whole of
his life, that he may fairly be ranked among the celebrities of
the town.&nbsp; He was the only son of John Dovaston, Esq., of
&ldquo;The Nursery,&rdquo; at Westfelton, a man also of great
natural talents, and who was distinguished for his science,
learning and ingenuity.&nbsp; The subject of our present notice
was educated for the Bar, <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>but having a dislike for the
profession, and possessing an ample property left by his father,
he preferred a life of literary leisure, amid the charming
scenery in his neighbourhood, to the wordy war and the feverish
excitement of forensic ambition.&nbsp; In his sylvan retreat he
sought amusement and instruction from the glories of nature so
profusely scattered around him, and with the pure taste of the
poet and philosopher, found</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sermons in stones,<br />
Tongues in trees, books in running brooks,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And good in every thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In early life he published a volume entitled
&ldquo;Fitz-Gwarine and other poems,&rdquo; to which he made
considerable additions in later years.&nbsp; He also published an
able discourse on Natural History, and contributed two lectures
on Music and National Melody.&nbsp; He was the author of a most
interesting sketch of Bewick, the clever wood-engraver, whom Mr.
Dovaston styled &ldquo;the celebrated xyographer and illustrator
of nature;&rdquo; wrote several prologues and epilogues to
histrionic performances for charitable purposes; and employed his
graceful pen so long as Providence gave him mental and bodily
strength.&nbsp; For several years, however, he was confined to
his bed, and died at the age of 72 years.&nbsp; His education was
commenced at Oswestry Free Grammar School, to which Institution
he reverts, in the pride of his manhood and the fervent
inspiration of the poet; and subsequently he was removed to
Shrewsbury School, where he remained for some years, under the
able tuition of Dr. Butler, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield.&nbsp;
Mr. Dovaston&rsquo;s poetic genius led him almost entirely into
the realms of nature.&nbsp; His ardent fancy revelled amid
flowers and trees, murmuring rivulets and mountain torrents, or
roamed among &ldquo;boxen bowers&rdquo; and greenwood shades,
where no sounds are heard but the drowsy hum of bees, the joyous
notes of the mavis or the lark, or the plaintive warblings of his
&ldquo;bonny robin.&rdquo;&nbsp; His metrical romance of
&ldquo;Fitz-Gwarine&rdquo; <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>gives evidence of high descriptive
power; and his Ballad, entitled &ldquo;Bala Water,&rdquo; will
bear comparison with the best stanzas of Scott.&nbsp; His works
will live in the district in which they were written, comprising
as they do so many local allusions; but had his muse soared to
loftier themes, he would, in all probability, have transmitted to
posterity a name which the lovers of song throughout the land
would have delighted to honour.&nbsp; Never having been married,
he left a considerable property, which is now in the possession
of his relation, John Dovaston, Esq.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guto</span> (<span class="smcap">y
Glyn</span>,) or <i>Griffith</i>, of <i>Glyn</i>, having been
elected a burgess of Oswestry, is entitled from that distinction,
as well as from his genius as a poet, to a brief notice.&nbsp; We
have already quoted from his quaint description of Oswestry, but
we shall now give it entire, as it was this production of his
muse that procured for him the honour of enrolment as a burgess
of the town.&nbsp; He was a native of Llangollen, and domestic
bard to the Abbot of Llanegwestl, or Valle Crucis, near that
town, to whom several of his poems are addressed.&nbsp; He is
represented as witty and social, and was an acceptable guest at
the halls of the Welsh nobility and gentry in his triennial
visitations through the Principality.&nbsp; His gentle muse must
have been more than ordinarily gracious when he poured forth such
mellifluous strains as the following, in honour of
Oswestry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oswestry is the liberal, the best endowed
of cities;<br />
The beloved of heaven that draws me to it.<br />
<i>Oswestry</i> the strong fort of conquerors; the <i>London</i>
of Powys;<br />
Where the houses are well stored with wine, and the land is
rich.<br />
Its school is celebrated, and its city for preachers and men of
science.<br />
<span class="smcap">God</span> is present in its beautiful
temple&mdash;<br />
A church adorned with rich chalices,<br />
And with bells and a rich-toned organ.<br />
No better choir is there from it to Canterbury:<br />
None in which there is correcter singing,<br />
Or the habilments more suitable.<br />
To <i>White Minster</i> I know no convent superior.<br />
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>The
handsomest and best-dressed women are those of Oswestry.<br />
It resembles Cheapside in merchandize,<br />
And its people are honest and unanimous.<br />
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace be with the city,
and those that dwell therein;<br />
May <span class="smcap">God</span> be its guardian and kind
preserver.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Humphrey Humphreys</span>, D.D., an
eminent prelate, born November 24th, 1648, was for some years
placed at the Free School of Oswestry, under the care of his
uncle, Humphrey Wynn, A.M., who was master of the school and
vicar of the parish.&nbsp; Bishop Humphreys was an able Welsh
antiquary, and wrote some memoirs of eminent Welshmen, in
addition to those contained in Wood&rsquo;s <i>Athen&aelig;
Oxonienses</i>, printed in the last edition of that work, and in
the first volume of the <i>Cambrian Register</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
was a person of excellent virtues during the whole course of his
life, and in his latter years of a piety so extraordinary, as has
but few examples.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Jones</span>, son of John Williams,
was born in Oswestry, and distinguished himself as an able
defender of the Protestant faith.&nbsp; Having received his early
education in his native town, he was entered at Jesus College,
Oxford, at the commencement of the rebellion, but he left the
University soon after, and returned when Oxford was surrendered
to the Parliament, in 1646.&nbsp; He became Fellow of University
College, by authority, of the parliamentary visitors, in 1648,
and was remarkably zealous in the republican cause.&nbsp; He took
the degree of M.A. in the year following, and in 1655 became
rector of Castell Caerinion, in Montgomeryshire, where he
acquired a knowledge of the Welsh language, to serve those parts
where the orthodox clergy were rejected.&nbsp; His subsequent
life was marked by strong zeal against papacy, and in an action
for slander brought against him by Dr. Morley, Bishop of
Winchester, whom he charged as a promoter of popery, he was fined
&pound;300, and the rectory of Llandyrnog, to which he had been
appointed, was sequestered for the payment of it.&nbsp; He
continued this severe course of <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>polemic warfare, and published
several other works, amongst which, in 1682, &ldquo;Elymas the
Sorcerer; or a memorial towards the discovery of the bottom of
this Popish Plot.&rdquo;&nbsp; This effusion exposed him to much
persecution, and would have subjected him to further punishment,
had he not escaped by his decease, which occurred at Totteridge,
Herts, in the same year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Humphrey Kynaston</span>, surnamed <i>The
Wild</i>.&mdash;This remarkable man, whose exploits would furnish
skilful romance-writers with materials for at least three
entertaining volumes, was not a native of Oswestry, but as there
is a tradition that his first wife was Elizabeth, daughter of
Meredydd ab Hywel ab Morris, of Oswestry, and another that she
was Margaret, daughter of William Griffith, of Oswestry, called
Coch-William, or the <i>Red</i>, we have deemed his history
worthy of brief narration in this volume.&nbsp; Kynaston was son
of Sir Roger Kynaston, of Hordley, by Elizabeth, daughter of
Henry Grey, Earl of Tankerville, by Antigony, daughter of
Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.&nbsp; The enormous debts he
contracted by his imprudent life and conduct caused him to be
outlawed, upon which he fled from Middle Castle, his usual place
of residence, but which he had so neglected that it was falling
into ruins, and sheltered himself in a cave in the western point
of Nesscliff Rock, called to this day <i>Kynaston&rsquo;s
Cave</i>.&nbsp; The cave is large, and divided into two rooms by
a pillar of the rock, upon which is carved &ldquo;H. K.
1564.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yorke says of him, that &ldquo;he was a
gentleman of many strange pranks, still the talk of the
neighbouring peasantry.&nbsp; The cave in the rock, at Nesscliff,
called Kynaston&rsquo;s Cave, was the retreat of himself and mad
companions.&nbsp; He was outlawed the sixth of Henry VII.,
pardoned the next year, and died in 1531.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kynaston&rsquo;s career was brief, but his exploits and vagaries
within the short period of twelve months filled the country round
with enthusiastic reports of his courage and semi-madness.&nbsp;
His horse, somewhat resembling <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>the notorious Turpin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Black Bess,&rdquo; seemed to have an instinctive knowledge
of his master&rsquo;s love of daring adventure.&nbsp; Tradition
states that this animal was stalled in the cave, the ascent to
which was by a flight of steps, and that when he was grazing in
any of the fields below, on hearing his master&rsquo;s whistle,
he would immediately attend to the summons, ascend the steps of
the cave, and kneel at Humphrey&rsquo;s bidding.&nbsp; Kynaston
is represented as no common outlaw, and that in all his
depredatory warfare he ever regarded a sort of justice, giving
freely to the poor, by whom he was idolized, a portion of the
&ldquo;black mail&rdquo; he had levied from the rich.&nbsp; On
the road, if he saw a cart with one horse, and another with
three, he made them equal, by taking the fore-horse from the
latter and hooking it to the former.&nbsp; Most of the adventures
ascribed to him seem to have been more dictated by whim than a
desire of plunder.&nbsp; He had a plentiful supply of necessaries
from the people around, the rich paying him tribute through fear,
and the poor from gratitude.&nbsp; <i>Kynaston&rsquo;s
Horse-leap</i>, a place thus named on Dovaston Common, received
its name from the following circumstance: Kynaston having been
observed to go over Montford Bridge to Shrewsbury, the Sheriff,
intending to take him, caused one of the divisions of the bridge
(then formed of planks laid upon stone pillars,) to be taken up,
and placed a number of men in ambush.&nbsp; When Kynaston had
advanced on the bridge, the men came up and blocked up his
retreat, upon which he put spurs to his horse, which bore him
safely over the wide breach, and carried him to his cave at
Nesscliff; some say the horse leaped into the Severn, and carried
him across!&nbsp; The length of this leap was afterwards measured
on Dovaston Common, with an H cut at one end and a K at the
other.&nbsp; The letters were an ell long, a spade&rsquo;s graffe
wide, and a spade deep, and were generally cleansed annually by
order of Mr. Kynaston, of Kington, as Gough, the historian of
Middle, informs us.&nbsp; Camden merely mentions Nesscliff and
its cave, but says not a word about Kynaston.&nbsp; Wild <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>Humphrey&rsquo;s adventures were probably much
exaggerated by the vulgar people of the district, some of whom
have not scrupled to declare that his leap was forty yards!&nbsp;
Kynaston, being a desperate man, would not hesitate much at
daring feats, but a forty yards&rsquo; leap is fit only for
record in the pages of Major Longbow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Edward Llwyd</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Lloyd</span>, the celebrated antiquary, although
not a native of Oswestry, was closely connected with it, as he
was the natural son of Edward Lloyd, of Llanforda, a man of
dissolute character, and who, after dissipating his estate, died
without legitimate issue.&nbsp; Edward Llwyd was born in 1660,
and at the age of seventeen was entered in Jesus College,
Oxford.&nbsp; He studied fossils, and became under-keeper of the
<i>Ashmolean Museum</i>, and in 1680 succeeded to the
head-keeper&rsquo;s place, vacant by the resignation of his
friend and patron, Dr. Plot.&nbsp; In 1704 he took the degree of
M.A.&nbsp; His researches into the languages, histories, and
customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain obtained for
him a distinguished name; but the chief fruit of his studies and
travels was his &ldquo;<i>Arch&aelig;ologi&aelig;
Britannica</i>,&rdquo; of which Baxter, in a letter to Sir Hans
Sloane, said, &ldquo;That it was the work of an age, rather than
of a few years; that it gave great light to the history and
antiquities of Britain, and was an honour to his ancient
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society,
and in the following year the University gave &ldquo;proof of the
high esteem in which it held his extensive learning, by electing
him Esquire Beadle in Divinity;&rdquo; but he did not long enjoy
the appointment, as he died after a few days&rsquo; illness, in
June 1709.&nbsp; His manuscript collections, relating to Welsh
and Irish antiquities, consisted of above forty volumes in folio,
ten in quarto, and upwards of one hundred of smaller sizes.&nbsp;
They were ultimately sold to Sir Thomas Seabright, of Beachwood,
Herts, and were afterwards purchased from Sir John Seabright,
part by the late Thomas Johnes, Esq., of Hafod, and the other <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>part by the
late Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart., of Wynnstay.&nbsp; Some years
afterwards, Mr. Johnes&rsquo; portion of these literary-treasures
were consumed in a destructive fire that broke out at his elegant
mansion, and a similar fate befel the more valuable of the
Wynnstay portion, they having been consumed in a fire which
occurred on the premises of a bookbinder in Covent-garden,
London, where they had been sent for the purpose of being
bound.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William Maurice</span>, of <span
class="smcap">Cefn-y-Braich</span>, and <span class="smcap">Hugh
Morus</span>, the <span class="smcap">Bard of
Ceiriog</span>.&mdash;These two able men, although not
Oswestrians, were so closely connected with the town, as natives
of the neighbouring parish of Llansilin, that a few words on
their biography will not be misplaced.&nbsp; Mr. <i>Maurice</i>
was an eminent antiquary, and the industrious collector of the
library of manuscripts now in the Wynnstay library.&nbsp; He was
descended from Lowri, sister of Owen Glyndwr, and what is
singularly coincident, he married Letitia, a descendant of
Glyndwr&rsquo;s successful opponent, Henry Bolingbroke.&nbsp; She
was a Kynaston, of Morton, descended from the Greys of Powys, and
the Greys from Antigony, daughter of Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester, fourth son of Henry IV.&nbsp; William Maurice was so
devoted to Welsh literature, that he erected close to his house,
at Cefn-y-Braich, a building three stories in height, for his
library.&nbsp; It was called &ldquo;The Study,&rdquo; but has
long since been in ruins.&nbsp; Mr. Walter Davies says of it,
&ldquo;From what I recollect of it, and of a print in an old
Oxford almanack of &lsquo;Friar Bacon&rsquo;s Study,&rsquo; in
that university, I judge the one to have been a <i>fac simile</i>
of the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; This assiduous antiquary died from
about 1680 to 1690.</p>
<p><i>Hugh Morus</i>, the Poet, as he is emphatically called,
because he excelled all others in the smooth and flowing
<i>awen</i>, or song-writing, was born at Pont-y-Meibion, in the
Vale of Ceiriog, in the year 1622.&nbsp; He died in 1709, at the
advanced <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>age of 87 years, as appears from his tomb-stone in
Llansilin church-yard having lived in six reigns, exclusive of
the commonwealth.&nbsp; His songs, carols, &amp;c., hundreds in
number show his fertile genius, and many of his productions are
marked by wit, irony, fun, satire, and high poetic beauty.&nbsp;
He was a frequent visitor at Porkington and Chirk Castle, and
always a welcome guest.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Reynolds</span>.&mdash;This
gentleman, a native of Oswestry, was a nephew of Mr. John Davies,
of Rhiwlas, Denbighshire, author of a small work entitled
&ldquo;<i>Heraldry Displayed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; After his
uncle&rsquo;s death he published a <i>Book of Pedigrees</i>, from
Mr. Davies&rsquo;s manuscript, in the quarto form.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Rev. Peter Roberts</span>, A.M., an
able writer on Welsh history, resided in Oswestry for some
time.&nbsp; He was born at Rhuabon, Denbighshire, in 1760, and in
1810 was presented to the living of Llanarmon Dyffryn
Ceiriog.&nbsp; He was prevented by the delicate state of his
health from residing on his living for more than a few of the
summer months, his regular home being in the town of Oswestry,
where he was generally respected for his literary talents and
private worth.&nbsp; In 1814 the freedom of the borough was
presented in full assembly to Mr. Roberts, as &ldquo;Author of
numerous and extensive publications,&rdquo; &ldquo;for his deep
and laborious researches of ancient records,&rdquo; and &ldquo;in
consideration of his profound learning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Astronomy
and the Oriental languages were his favourite studies in the
early part of his life, and he had aspired to the Astronomical
Chair in Trinity College, Dublin, as successor to the celebrated
Archbishop Usher, whose friendship and regard he had long
possessed.&nbsp; The illustration of his native language, and of
the ancient history of the Cymry, afterwards deeply engaged his
attention, and to the discussion of these subjects he brought
such powers of mind, united with such multifarious learning, that
he reminded his contemporaries of the gigantic power of the
renowned Edward Llwyd, and <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>justly entitled himself to the high
eulogium of Bishop Horsley, who declared &ldquo;there was only
<i>one</i> Peter Roberts in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He closed his
earthly career at Halkin, Flintshire, in 1821, whilst
administering relief to a poor parishioner; he was seized with
apoplexy, and died in a few hours afterwards.&nbsp; His published
works were numerous and able.&nbsp; In the list we find
&ldquo;Christianity vindicated, in a series of letters to Mr.
Volney;&rdquo; &ldquo;Harmony of the Epistles;&rdquo; &ldquo;an
essay on the Origin of the Constellations;&rdquo; &ldquo;Art of
Universal Correspondence;&rdquo; &ldquo;A Sketch of the Early
History of the Cymry or Ancient Britons;&rdquo; &ldquo;Review of
the Policy and Peculiar Doctrines of the Church of Rome;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Manual of Prophecy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Collectanea
Cambrica;&rdquo; &ldquo;Letter to Dr. Milner, on the supposed
miracle at St. Winifred&rsquo;s Well;&rdquo; &ldquo;Cambrian

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dick Spot</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;A
man figuring under this patronymic, but whose real name was
Edward Morris, flourished at Oswestry some years ago.&nbsp; He
was celebrated as a conjuror or professor of legerdemain, and
pursued his tricks with such marvellous success that the name of
&ldquo;<i>Dick Spot</i>&rdquo; was popular among the humbler
classes throughout the district.&nbsp; He professed to tell a
love-sick damsel who was to be her husband; to detect thieves by
turning a key upon the Bible; and by other &ldquo;craft and
subtlety&rdquo; inspired his credulous visitors with hopes of
coming grandeur and overflowing fortunes, &amp;c.&nbsp; At length
death arrested Morris in his deceptive career, and his remains
were consigned to the earth in Oswestry Church-yard.&nbsp;
Hulbert, in a notice of Oswestry, in his &ldquo;History of the
County,&rdquo; refers to Dick Spot&rsquo;s career, and says,
&ldquo;On requesting an eccentric but ingenious inhabitant, now
one of the Churchwardens, to furnish me with some particulars of
a pamphlet said to be the Life of <i>Dick Spot</i>, he thus
replied,&mdash;&lsquo;I know not who has got his life, but this I
know, that I am in possession of his mortal remains in <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>Oswestry
Church-yard, having purchased the spot of earth which contained
them, from his grand-daughter.&nbsp; His skull, which I had in my
hand the other day, was treated with very little respect by the
Hamlet-like grave digger.&rsquo;&nbsp; If poor Morris had been
blessed with the gift of foresight, he certainly would have
directed that his mortal remains should be deposited in a more
secure place of sepulture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who the eccentric
Churchwarden was the historian does not inform us.&nbsp; We are
half inclined to believe that his <i>grave</i> discovery was a
hoax, a species of pleasantry, somewhat resembling what is called
&ldquo;Bolton Trotting,&rdquo; and which two or three well-known
wags were wont to indulge in, many years ago, occasionally with
thoughtless imprudence and merciless severity.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Salter</span>.&mdash;This
gentleman&rsquo;s family had for centuries been connected with
Oswestry, the name of &ldquo;Salter&rdquo; being recorded in
civic documents of very ancient date.&nbsp; He was author of a
piscatorial work, entitled &ldquo;<i>The Modern
Angler</i>,&rdquo; a <i>brochure</i>, written in a series of
letters to a disciple of Isaac Walton, and evidencing a
thoroughly-practical acquaintance with the art of angling.&nbsp;
It was published in 1811.&nbsp; Like that celebrated lover of the
finny tribes, he looks upon his favourite recreation with the
warmest enthusiasm of his craft, and quotes Walton&rsquo;s
refreshing picture of some of the angler&rsquo;s joys on closing
a long day&rsquo;s sport.&nbsp; Safely landed at some
&ldquo;friendly cottage, where the landlady is good, and the
daughter innocent and beautiful: where the room is cleanly, with
lavender in the sheets, and twenty ballads stuck about the wall;
there he can enjoy the company of a talkative brother sportsman,
have his trouts dressed for his supper, tell tales, sing old
tunes, or make a catch.&nbsp; There he can talk of the wonders of
nature, with learned admiration, or find some harmless sport to
content him, and pass away a little time, without offence to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, or injury to man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Salter&rsquo;s Letters are worthy of re-publication.</p>

inscription in the centre was as follows:&mdash;(Surmounted by
the Arms of Oswestry).&nbsp; &ldquo;To John Robert Kenyon,
D.C.L., <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

of the town of Oswestry, in testimony of the deep respect in
which he is held as Recorder of the borough, and the grateful
feelings entertained for his liberal support of the different
charitable institutions connected with the
town.&rdquo;&mdash;(The Family Arms below.)</p>
<p>Oswestry is 450 feet above the level of the sea, and 254 feet
higher than the Shrewsbury meadows.&nbsp; Shrewsbury is 196 feet
above the level of the sea.</p>
<p>The following heights of places above the sea, either near or
in sight of the Great Western Railway (Birmingham, Shrewsbury,
and Chester Sections,) taken by the Rev. T. E. Evans, of Trinity
College, Cambridge, are &ldquo;facts worth
knowing:&rdquo;&mdash;Hawkstone, 834 feet; Grinshill, 696;
Nesscliff, 630; Llanymynech church, 246; Breiddin, 1,236; Wrekin,
1,494.; Cyrn Moelfre, 1,746; Cader Ferwyn, 2,826; Cern-y-Bwch,

Shrewsbury, 97; surface of the Ellesmere canal under Heathhouse
bridge, 260 feet.&nbsp; The canal at Chirk is the height of two
locks more than the canal near Whittington.&nbsp; Allowing 24
feet for the rise, it would make the surface of the canal at
Chirk, 334 feet.</p>
<p>The late Rev. Walter Davies, rector of Manafon, in his
Historical notice of Llansilin, published in the first volume of
the <i>Cambro-Briton</i>, says, &ldquo;In 1699 there was a well
in the parish of Oswestry, called <i>Ffynnon Maen Tysilio</i>,
where the inhabitants resorted to celebrate their annual
Wake.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Oswestry Show</i>, long since discontinued, was generally
held on the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday.&nbsp; As a
pageant it bore no comparison with Shrewsbury Show.&nbsp; The
incorporated companies of the town walked in procession, preceded
with flags, bands of music, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&ldquo;There was formerly,&rdquo; says the <i>Oswestry
Herald</i>, &ldquo;a castle at Maesbury, in that township, as we
find from Domesday Book.&nbsp; Rainald the Sheriff (all whose
estates devolved on the Fitz-Alans,) held Maesburie under Roger
et ibi fecit Rainaldus Castellum Lvvre.&rdquo;&nbsp; No mention
of this castle is made by Pennant, Bingley, or any subsequent
historian or tourist.</p>

241</span>Sketches<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
The Environs of Oswestry.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sufficient</span> has been said in these
pages to justify much more extended notices than we can give to
the ancient castles, fine old mansions, and modern residences of
wealthy proprietors in this neighbourhood, imparting as they do
so much additional beauty and interest to the bold and
picturesque natural scenery in the midst of which they are so
tastefully situated.&nbsp; Oswestry, as we have already
described, is not only a pretty town, but historically curious;
and the charms of nature and art surrounding it render it still
more worthy of admiration.&nbsp; We append brief descriptions of
neighbouring places, all fixed near the Border Lands of England
and Wales, whose history teems with glowing narratives of
embattled hosts, of fierce chieftains in bright array, and of
minstrels famed</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Cambria&rsquo;s noon of story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere bright she set in
glory!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost every nook and corner has its historic tale, its love
or war-song, or its tradition.&nbsp; These remains of ancient
times and deeds of bravery, with natural beauties
superadded,&mdash;mountains, valleys, and rivers, of surpassing
loveliness, have <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>invested the Environs of Oswestry with an enduring
interest with which few, if any other towns in the kingdom, can
vie.&nbsp; Our <span class="smcap">District Sketches</span>,
being arranged alphabetically, will commence with</p>
<h3>ASTON HALL,</h3>
<p>The seat of Mrs. Lloyd, widow of the late William Lloyd,
Esq.&nbsp; It is situated on the right of the turnpike-road from
Oswestry to Shrewsbury, about two miles distant from the
former.&nbsp; The highly-respected family who have for so many
years occupied this beautiful estate are of great antiquity,
having descended from Einion, Prince of part of Powys, who
distinguished himself in the wars against Henry I.&nbsp; Yorke,
in his &ldquo;<i>Royal Tribes of Wales</i>,&rdquo; writing in
1799, has furnished a copious notice of the house of Aston.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lloyds,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;are
descended from Einion.&nbsp; The heiress of the house, Elizabeth,
daughter of Thomas Lloyd, married Foulke Lloyd, of Fox Hall, or
the hall of Foulke, and was great grandmother to the Rev. John
Robert Lloyd, Rector of Whittington and Selattyn, both in his
advowson, the present possessor of Aston.&nbsp; The name of the
Fox Hall family was Rosindale, when they came first from the
north.&nbsp; To a younger branch, settled at Denbigh, we owe our
learned countryman, Humphrey Llwyd.&nbsp; He was of Brazen-nose,
Oxford, studied physic, and lived as family physician in the
house of the last Earl of Arundel, of the name of Fitz-Alan, the
Chancellor of the University.&nbsp; He sat in Parliament for his
native town of Denbigh, and died there in the forty-first year of
his age, and was buried in the Parish Church with a coarse
monument, a dry epitaph, and a psalm-tune under it.&nbsp; He
collected many curious books for Lord Lumley (whose sister he
married), which form at this time a valuable part of the Library
in the British Museum.&nbsp; One of his sons was settled at
Cheam, in Surrey, whose great grandson, Robert Lloyd, was Rector
of St. Paul&rsquo;s, Covent Garden, and contended, but without
effect, for the Barony of Lumley.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Aston
Chapel was built in 1594, at the expense of Richard Lloyd, Esq.,
of Aston, and then called Christ&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp; It was
endowed by its founder with &pound;15 per annum, and Anne, his
wife, left by will &pound;5 per annum in land to the Chapel, and
40s. for four Welsh sermons to be preached in the year, with 15s.
to be distributed to the poor of Oswestry parish at each
sermon.&nbsp; The chapel was consecrated by Bishop Parry.</p>
<h3>BRYNKINALT,</h3>
<p>The seat of the Right Hon. Viscount Dungannon, is situated
about a mile from Chirk, and one of the most picturesque mansions
in the Principality.&nbsp; The house was built during the reign
of James I., from a design by Inigo Jones, and is situated on the
brow of a hill, at the foot of which flows the Ceiriog.&nbsp; The
park is fine, and is divided by the river.&nbsp; On the site of
this house formerly stood the residence of Tudor Trevor, a
British nobleman who lived A.D. 924, the head of the tribe of
March or Maelor, and who bore the title of Earl of Hereford in
right of his mother, the daughter and heiress of Lluddocca, ab
Caradog Vreichvras, Earl of Hereford.&nbsp; Trevor had large
possessions between the Wye and Severn, and was Lord of both
Maelors, Chirk, Whittington, Oswestry, &amp;c.&nbsp; His chief
residence was Whittington Castle; he was contemporary of Hywel
Dda, the Welsh law-giver; and Angharad, daughter of Hywel, became
the chieftain&rsquo;s wife, and had by him three sons and one
daughter.&nbsp; The arms of this distinguished man, which are
still borne by the Trevor family, are&mdash;&ldquo;Parted per
bend sinister ermine and ermines, over all a lion rampant,
or.&rdquo;&nbsp; Debrett informs us that &ldquo;Arthur Hill,
first Viscount, was only brother of Trevor, Viscount
Hillsborough, ancestor of the Marquess of Downshire, and grandson
of William Hill, who married secondly Mary, eldest daughter of
Sir Marcus Trevor, Viscount Dungannon; so created, 1662, for his
signal gallantry in wounding Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of
Marston moor.&nbsp; Arthur, succeeding, 1762, to the estates of
his maternal grandfather, Sir John <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Trevor, of Brynkinalt, Speaker of
the House of Commons in England, and first Lord Commissioner of
the Great Seal, assumed the name and arms of Trevor, and was
created, April 27th, 1765, Viscount Dungannon.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
interesting fact connected with this noble family is, that the
mother of the Duke of Wellington, the &ldquo;Hero of a hundred
fights,&rdquo; was Anne, Countess of Mornington, daughter of
Arthur Hill, the first Viscount Dungannon.&nbsp; This illustrious
lady was closely allied with two greatly-distinguished men: her
husband, the Earl of Mornington, ranked high as a musical
composer, and &ldquo;the Duke,&rdquo; her son, placed himself
high on the roll of fame with conquerors of ancient and modern
renown.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The present Viscount Dungannon takes much interest in
arch&aelig;ological pursuits, and is author of an ably-written
work, in two volumes, 8vo., entitled &ldquo;The Life and Times of
William the Third, King of England, and Stadtholder of
Holland.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Lordship has acquired the literary
distinctions of M.A., F.A.S., and M.R.S.L., and is an active
magistrate for the district in which he resides.&nbsp; He has
large possessions in the north of Ireland, in which he takes much
interest.</p>
<h3>CHIRK CASTLE,</h3>
<p>The noble residence of Colonel Myddelton Biddulph, is situated
near to Chirk, on elevated ground on the Berwyn range of hills,
commanding delightful views of the surrounding scenery.&nbsp; It
is a bold castellated mansion, built of grey stone, partly
mantled with ivy, and is supposed to have been erected on the
site of an ancient fortress called by the Welsh <i>Castell
Crogen</i>, near which, as is recorded, the celebrated Battle of
Crogen took place in 1164, when the Welsh fought with more than
their usual bravery against Henry II., for the recovery of their
independence.&nbsp; The present castle was built in the reign of
Edward I. by Roger Mortimer, son of Roger, Baron of Wigmore, to
whom the king had granted the united lordship of Chirk and
Nanheudwy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p244b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Chirk Castle"
title=
"Chirk Castle"
 src="images/p244s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>The
Castle continued in the hands of the Mortimer family but a short
period, it being sold by John, grandson of Roger Mortimer, to
Richard Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, whose family possessed it for
three generations.&nbsp; It afterwards passed to Thomas Mowbray,
Duke of Norfolk and Justice of North Wales, Chester, and Flint,
in right of his wife, Elizabeth, eldest sister to Thomas, Earl of
Arundel.&nbsp; It then devolved upon the Beauchamp and Neville
families, and afterwards became the property of Sir William
Stanley, together with Holt Castle.&nbsp; Henry VIII. bestowed it
upon his natural son, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond and
Somerset; in the following reign it was granted to Thomas, Lord
Seymour, brother to the Protector Somerset.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth
granted it to her favourite Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and on his
death it became the property of Lord St. John, of Bletso, whose
son, in 1595, sold it to Sir Thomas Myddelton, Knight, Lord Mayor
of London, in a branch of whose family it still remains.</p>
<p>It is stated that the erection of the Castle was begun in
1011, and finished in 1013.&nbsp; The building partakes both of
the castle and mansion, the form quadrangular, the angles being
strengthened with bastion-like towers, each surmounted by a small
turret.&nbsp; The principal entrance, through a fifth massive
arched tower, is at the north front, leading into a court-yard
160 feet long by 100 broad.&nbsp; Around this are ranged the
different apartments, and the east side is ornamented by a
handsome colonnaded piazza.&nbsp; The north and east wings are
occupied by the family, and the south and west given up to the
offices.&nbsp; The most remarkable of the apartments are, a
saloon of sixty feet by thirty, lighted by three large mullioned
windows looking towards the court; a drawing-room thirty feet
square; and an oak gallery, extending the whole length of the
west wing, one hundred feet by twenty-two, leading to the
chapel.&nbsp; The ceilings throughout are ornamented by rich
plaster work, and the rooms display a large collection of
paintings.&nbsp; Among <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>the portraits are those of the
Myddelton family, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, the Duke of Ormond, and
his son Lord Ossory, the Countess of Warwick, daughter of the
fourth Sir Thomas Myddelton, and afterwards wife to the
celebrated Addison, author of the &ldquo;<i>Spectator</i>&rdquo;
and other classic writings.&nbsp; Among the landscapes there is a
view of the admired water-fall, <i>Pistill Rhaiadr</i>, in
Montgomeryshire, represented as falling into the sea.&nbsp; Of
this work of art a pleasant story is told.&nbsp; The artist
employed in taking the view was a foreigner, to whom it was
hinted, when he had nearly finished the picture, that the
addition of a few sheep would add to the effect.&nbsp; The
painter replied, &ldquo;you want some <i>sheeps in it</i>.&nbsp;
O!&nbsp; O! ver veil.&nbsp; I vill put you some <i>sheeps</i>
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then introduced the sea, and with it several
<i>ships</i>!&nbsp; The picture being thus ludicrously
transformed, it was allowed to remain in its altered state as an
artistic curiosity; and the visitor when inspecting it is sure to
have his risible muscles disturbed by so droll a
metamorphosis.&nbsp; The gallery contains several old cabinets,
the work probably of Italian or French Artists; one, an
exceedingly handsome one, a gift from Charles II. to the brave
Sir Thomas Myddelton.</p>
<p>The history of the Myddelton family is one of national
interest.&nbsp; There were four Sir Thomas Myddeltons at Chirk
Castle, the two former knights, and the two latter
baronets.&nbsp; The first Sir Thomas was Lord Mayor of London
when his brother, the celebrated Hugh Myddelton, was knighted for
bringing the new river into the Metropolis.&nbsp; The second Sir
Thomas served in Parliament for the county of Denbigh, and took
arms in its support when he was fifty-seven years old.&nbsp; For
his services at Oswestry, Montgomery, and Holt, in 1643&ndash;4,
he received the thanks of Parliament through the Speaker.&nbsp;
When he engaged in the service of the Parliament his own castle
became garrisoned for the king, and the veteran knight was
compelled to besiege it with all his force.&nbsp; It remained,
however, in the hands of the royalists till February <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>1646, when
Sir John Watts, the governor, quitted it, and was captured, with
his men, at Churchstoke, Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Myddelton, some ten years afterwards, abandoned the parliamentary
cause, and took up arms with Sir George Booth, a Cheshire
general, to restore the monarchy, and place Charles II. on the
throne.&nbsp; The royalists were few in number, and easily
defeated, by Lambert, who retook Chester, and made Sir George
Booth prisoner.&nbsp; He then laid siege to Chirk Castle, which,
after a sharp resistance, was surrendered by Sir Thomas
Myddelton, who deemed it useless, he said, to oppose the whole
kingdom.&nbsp; A resolution was passed in parliament, authorizing
Lambert to demolish the Castle; but, Cromwell dying the same
year, the threatened destruction did not take place.&nbsp; The
damage and loss sustained at Chirk Castle, during the usurpation,
are said to have amounted to &pound;130,000.&nbsp; Such was the
reward which the veteran Sir Thomas Myddelton received for his
patriotism.&nbsp; His fate resembled that of his co-patriot,
Major-General Mytton, but was somewhat more disastrous.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas&rsquo;s son, of the same name, was made a baronet
at the Restoration.&nbsp; The son died in 1663, his father
surviving him three years, when he died at the age of 80
years.&nbsp; His grandson, the fourth Sir Thomas, and the second
baronet, married twice.&nbsp; By his second wife, Charlotte,
daughter of the Lord-Keeper Bridgeman, he had an only daughter,
Charlotte, who married first to the Earl of Warwick, and secondly
to Addison, as already mentioned.&nbsp; Their daughter, Miss
Addison, died unmarried.&nbsp; The baronetage became extinct at
the death of Sir William, son of Sir Richard, brother to the last
Sir Thomas, Sir William having died unmarried in 1718.&nbsp; The
estate, by the entailment, came to Robert Myddelton, eldest son
of Richard, the third son of Sir Thomas, the soldier.&nbsp; He,
dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother John, father of
Richard, father of Richard Myddelton, Esq., for many years M.P.
for the Denbigh boroughs, who died <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>unmarried in 1796.&nbsp; The estate
was afterwards divided among his three sisters.&nbsp; The eldest,
Mrs. Myddelton Biddulph, had for her share Chirk Castle and its
domain, and it is now in the possession, as before stated, of her
son, Col. Myddelton Biddulph.&nbsp; The second sister, Maria, who
married the Hon. Frederick West, brother of the late Earl of
Delawarr, had for her portion the property in Llangollen,
Rhuabon, Wrexham, and Holt.&nbsp; The third sister had for her
portion Ruthin Castle with its demesnes, and died unmarried; her
property, with that of the Hon. F. West, came into possession of
his son, Frederick Richard West, Esq., M.P. for the Denbigh
Boroughs, who now resides at Ruthin Castle, a portion of which
has been re-built, and the whole greatly embellished under his
tasteful superintendence.</p>
<p>Chirk Castle is among the most interesting and
oldest-inhabited feudal buildings in the kingdom.&nbsp; Its</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Towers, unmodernized by tasteless art,
remain<br />
Still unsubdued by time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The family have hitherto protected it from injury, as it has
been repaired with care and skill where much decay or damage had
presented itself, but in no degree to impair its original
character.&nbsp; Within the last few years considerable
improvements and alterations have been made in it, under the
direction and superintendence of the late Mr. Pugin.&nbsp; The
lower apartments are of the pure gothic of the fifteenth
century.&nbsp; The large rooms are in the style of Francois the
First.&nbsp; The bed in which Charles I. slept when he visited
Chirk Castle, in his &ldquo;utmost need,&rdquo; in 1646, is still
shown in a room adjoining the gallery.&nbsp; The south-west wing
has undergone little if any alteration by modern art, and there
may still be traced the architecture of the period in which the
fortress was erected.</p>
<p>The large estate surrounding the Castle has been much improved
by Col. Myddelton Biddulph; the grounds and <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>noble trees
that ornament it are kept in excellent order, and the farms upon
the property are all in a nourishing and healthy condition.</p>
<p>Col. Myddelton Biddulph is Lord Lieutenant of the county of
Denbigh, and representative also for the shire.</p>
<h3>HALSTON,</h3>
<p>The seat of Edmund Wright, Esq., was for several centuries the
property of the Myttons.&nbsp; It is situated within a mile of
Whittington, on the Oswestry and Ellesmere turnpike road.&nbsp;
It is called in ancient deeds <i>Haly-stone</i> or
<i>Holy-stone</i>.&nbsp; Near the house stood the abbey, taken
down about a century and a half ago.&nbsp; The Rev. Peter Roberts
says, &ldquo;That it had been a sanctuary is evident.&nbsp;
Meyric Lloyd, lord of some part of <i>Uwch Ales</i>, in the reign
of Richard I., would not yield subjection to the English
Government, under which the Hundred of Dyffryn Clwyd and several
others were then, and having taken some English officers that
came there to execute the law, (which was contrary to the customs
of the Britons,) hanged some and killed others.&nbsp; For this
act he forfeited his lands to the king, fled, and <i>took
sanctuary</i> at Halston, where (for his notable enterprises and
merited chivalry,) he was taken under the protection of its
possessor, John Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel, &lsquo;who made him
general of the army in the besieging of Aeon, in Asia, anno dom.
1190, where he behaved himself,&rsquo; as Reynolds informs us,
&lsquo;with such dexterous attempts as were admirable to the
spectators.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; [See his exploits further
recorded in our notice of &ldquo;Llanforda.&rdquo;]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p248b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Halston"

"Halston"
 src="images/p248s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the Saxon era the Lordship of Halston belonged to Edric, at
which time there were on the property two Welshmen and one
Frenchman.&nbsp; After the Conquest Halston became the property
of an Earl of Arundel, or of Robert, Earl of Shrewsbury, and was
afterwards bestowed on the Knights of St. John of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; In the 26th Henry VIII. the commandry was valued
at &pound;160 14s. 10d. a year.&nbsp; On <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>the
abolition of many of the military-religious orders and
monasteries, Henry empowered John Sewster, Esq., Scutifer, and
afterwards allowed him to dispose of this manor to Alan Horde,
who made an exchange with, or sold it to Edward Mytton, Esq., of
Habberly, ancestor to the present John Mytton, Esq.&nbsp; This
alienation was subsequently confirmed by Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In a manuscript account of Halston, written in 1821 by the
late Rev. C. A. A. Lloyd, we find the following
description:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Manor of Halston is
extra-parochial.&nbsp; The Mansion-house of Halston was formerly
situated near the chapel, but in the year 1690 it was removed to
its present situation, which is on an elevated spot of ground
rising out of an extensive flat, and formerly subject to frequent
floods.&nbsp; The grandfather of the present owner (the late John
Mytton, Esq.,) was a gentleman of great spirit and enterprise,
and at considerable trouble and expense drained vast tracts of
the low ground, which rendered the neighbourhood more
healthy.&nbsp; The river Perry here forms several islands, and
its shores are shaded by oaks, perhaps the finest in the
country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After describing the pictures and books at Halston at the time
he was writing, he adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. W. Mytton was engaged for many years in
collecting materials for a History of the County, but
unfortunately died before he arranged them.&nbsp; Among the
collection is a manuscript copy of the History of the County, by
Mr. E. Lloyd, of Trenewydd, which Mr. Pennant, by some blunder,
mistook for Mr. Mytton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chapel of Halston is a donative, without any other revenue
than what the chaplain is allowed by the owner, and is of exempt
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Mytton family are of great antiquity, and their connection
with Shrewsbury is of remote date.&nbsp; The late John Mytton,
Esq., sold, among other property belonging to him in that town, a
field called the &ldquo;Chapel Yard,&rdquo; on Coton <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Hill.&nbsp;
When Leland visited Shrewsbury the Myttons lived on Coton
Hill.&nbsp; In the bailiff&rsquo;s accounts for a year from
Michaelmas, 2nd Richard III., among rents in decasu (in decay) is
one &ldquo;Procapella de Coten Thome Mytton,&rdquo; the sum
defaced; and his descendant Thomas Mytton, Esq., was rated for it
to the poor as late as 1686.&nbsp; Major-General Thomas Mytton,
the great parliamentary commander in the Civil Wars, was a
descendant of the Myttons of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Halston was his
birth-place, and he resided there for many years.&nbsp; He was a
zealous and untiring leader of the parliament forces under the
Commonwealth, and gave his days and nights to the
Protector&rsquo;s cause; but he lived long enough to realize the
truth of the poet&rsquo;s exclamation,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How wretched is the man that hangs on
Princes&rsquo; favours!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He saw men of inferior talent, but ostentatious in profession,
placed over him in rank, and had to suffer the penalty which many
others paid for their attachment to Cromwell&mdash;the neglect
and indifference of the party whom he had so long delighted to
serve, and the favour of the Protector extended to sycophants and
flatterers.</p>
<p>The late John Mytton, Esq., was the last member but one of the
family who possessed the Halston estates.&nbsp; This unfortunate
gentleman passed a brief life in folly and dissipation, and
closed his existence with an unenviable notoriety.&nbsp; On
reaching his majority he found himself the owner of immense
wealth, in money and landed property.&nbsp; Under pernicious
influences he plunged into extravagance, recklessly squandered
away his patrimony, and in a few years became the inmate of a
gaol,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Deserted at his utmost need,<br />
By those his former bounty fed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He drew his last breath within the gloomy walls of a prison,
at the early age of thirty-eight, and was interred, with his
ancestors, in the burial-ground at Halston Chapel.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>It is
painful to advert to so lamentable a career and so distressing an
end.&nbsp; But, whilst we point to Mr. Mytton&rsquo;s ruinous
habits, we cannot withhold the acknowledgment that he had
redeeming qualities.&nbsp; Like most men of his pursuits, he
often found the means he possessed too limited for his own wants;
yet occasionally he would perform noble and generous deeds, that
might be classed with the purest benevolence.&nbsp; His mental
calibre was of no common order.&nbsp; Had he been rightly
disciplined in his youth, and trained to habits of self-denial
and literary improvement, his life might have been honourable,
and extended to a good old age.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the
misfortune of John Mytton,&rdquo; as a county historian observes,
&ldquo;to lose his father in his infancy, and it is remarkable
that the heirs of the house of Halston have for several
generations been orphans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mytton was High Sheriff of Salop in 1823, and represented
Shrewsbury in the last parliament of George III., being elected
May 23rd, 1819.&nbsp; He was a candidate the second time for the
same borough, in March, 1820, the other candidates being Panton
Corbet, Esq., and the Hon. Henry Grey Bennett, but was then
defeated.&nbsp; His Parliamentary career was therefore but of
short duration; but brief and useless as it was, it cost him many
thousand pounds, to raise which a large portion of his Shrewsbury
and other property had to be sold.</p>
<p>Mr. Mytton married in 1818, soon after he became of age, a
daughter of Sir Thomas Jones, and sister of the late Sir Thomas
John Tyrwhitt Jones, of Stanley Hall, near Bridgenorth, by whom
he had one daughter only, who is now the wife of Captain Clement
Hill, a brother of Lord Hill.&nbsp; Mrs. Mytton died in 1820, and
in the following year he married Caroline, one of the daughters
of Thomas Giffard, Esq., of Chillington, in the county of
Stafford, by whom he had an eldest son John, (who sold the
Halston estate to Mr. Wright,) and several other children.&nbsp;
Mrs. Mytton survived her <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>husband, but at her death, although
from Mr. Mytton&rsquo;s erratic habits she had been compelled to
separate herself from him, she was, at her own request, laid in
the grave at Halston by his side.</p>
<p>The Halston Estate was purchased in April 1847 by the late
Edmund Wright, Esq., of Manchester, from the present Mr.
Mytton.&nbsp; The property was offered for sale by auction on the
13th of that month, at Dee&rsquo;s Royal Hotel, Birmingham.&nbsp;
At Mr. Wright&rsquo;s death it came into the possession of his
son, Edmund Wright, Esq., the present worthy owner.&nbsp; Since
his possession of the estate he has greatly improved it.&nbsp;
Additions have been made to the house, and he has otherwise
rendered it more convenient and ornamental.&nbsp; The park has
been thoroughly drained, four feet in depth, within the last
three or four years, the main drain being carried underneath the
upper pool, by which means an ample fall for the efficient
working of the drain is secured.</p>
<h3>KNOCKIN.</h3>
<p>We briefly notice this place, from its antiquity, and having
possessed a castle, erected in the reign of Henry II.&nbsp;
Knockin is in the hundred of Oswestry, as already stated; is a
rectory discharged, in the diocese of St. Asaph, and the deanery
of Marchia.&nbsp; It is situated five and a half miles south-east
of Oswestry.&nbsp; The origin of the name is not known.&nbsp;
There is no mention of it in Domesday Book, nor in any of the
British Chronicles before the Conquest.&nbsp; Camden refers to it
but with brevity.&nbsp; The castle was built by Lord
L&rsquo;Estrange, the first of whose family was Guy
L&rsquo;Estrange (Guido Extraneous,) a younger son of the Duke of
Bretagne.&nbsp; He had three sons, Guy, Hamon, and John, all of
whom held lands in Shropshire by gift from Henry II.&nbsp; The
younger Guy was Sheriff of Salop from the sixth to the eleventh
of Henry II.; and again from the seventeenth to the twenty-first
of Henry II., Ralph, his son, gave (the first of Richard II.) the
chapel of Knockin <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>to the canons of Haughmond.&nbsp; He left no issue, and
his three sisters became his co-heiresses.&nbsp; John, grandson
of Guy, in the thirty-third of Henry III., procured a market for
the town on a Tuesday, and a fair on the eve-day and day after
the anniversary of the decollation of St. John the Baptist.&nbsp;
Madog, who was at the head of an insurrection against the
king&rsquo;s officers in North Wales, marched against the Lord
Strange, and defeated him at Knockin.&nbsp; The male line of the
family failed in John Le Strange, who died in the seventeenth of
Edward IV., leaving an only daughter, Joan, who married George,
son and heir of Thomas Stanley, who was created Earl of Derby by
Henry VII.&nbsp; The castle was first demolished in the civil
wars in the reign of King John, and repaired by John Le Strange
in the third of Henry III.&nbsp; The title of Knockin is still
kept up, though the family is extinct, the eldest son in the
Derby family being styled Lord Strange.&nbsp; The castle was long
since a heap of ruins, and scarcely a vestige of it remains to be
seen.&nbsp; The materials of which it was composed were worked up
to build the church-walls, &amp;c.; and, &ldquo;tell it not in
Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon!&rdquo; cart-loads
of the stones were carried away to repair the roads!&nbsp; The
Poor-rate return for the parish gives the following
statements:&mdash;Acreage, 1,384; gross rental, &pound;2,131;
rateable value assessed to the relief of the poor,
&pound;1,916.</p>
<h3>LLANYMYNECH</h3>
<p>Is situated about six miles from Oswestry, on the
turnpike-road leading from thence to Welshpool.&nbsp; The parish
contains one township, <i>Carreg Hofa</i> (Offa&rsquo;s stone,)
which, although detached from, yet is within the county of
Denbigh, but attached to Montgomeryshire for election and other
purposes.&nbsp; The other two townships, Llwyntidman and
Treprenal, are within the county of Salop, but on the borders of
Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The church is dedicated to St.
Agatha.&nbsp; Patron,&mdash;the Bishop of St. Asaph.&nbsp; The
present Rector is the Rev. John Luxmoore.&nbsp; In the chancel is
a monument to the memory of <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the wife and daughter of George
Griffith, Bishop of St. Asaph, who had been Rector of this parish
whilst Canon of that Chapter.&nbsp; He was of the House of
Penrhyn, in Caernarvonshire, and was consecrated to the above See
in October 1660, in reward for his piety and great sufferings in
the royal cause.&nbsp; A tablet, in another part of the church,
has the following singular inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Randolph
Worthington, died in the West Indies, <i>of the yellow fever</i>,
<i>nobly fighting for his king and country</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
church and village are beautifully situated on a gentle slope
above the river Vyrnwy, and from Llanymynech Hill present the
appearance of a charming Swiss scene.&nbsp; Various
interpretations of the name of the village are given.&nbsp; Some
etymological writers have said that the word Llanymynech means
&ldquo;the Village of the Miners,&rdquo; whilst others contend
that it signifies &ldquo;the Church of the Monks, or
Monkstown.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the invasion of the Romans the hill
has been known as mineral ground, so that the origin of the name
&ldquo;Village of the Miners,&rdquo; is easily understood.&nbsp;
A monastery is said to have been in existence here at an early
date, and hence &ldquo;the Church of the Monks,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>

<p>An ancient mansion called <span class="smcap">Carreg Hofa
Castle</span> once stood in the parish, but was demolished about
the beginning <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>of the 13th century.&nbsp; Having been built of wood,
not a vestige of the Castle remains.&nbsp; A foss, to guard the
most inaccessible approach on the east, is the only index
left.&nbsp; It was taken and pillaged in 1162, by the two cousins
Owen Cyveiliog and Owen ab Madog.&nbsp; The latter kept
possession of it for twenty-five years, and was eventually slain
in it by Gwenwynwyn and Cadwallon, sons of Owen Cyveiliog.</p>
<p><i>Offa&rsquo;s Dyke</i> separates the parish into two nearly
equal parts, and continues its course as described in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page10">10</a></span>.&nbsp; The
river <i>Morda</i> divides the parish on the east from Kinnerley,
and on the north it joins the parish of Oswestry.</p>
<p><i>Llanymynech Hill</i> is an extensive tract of land, on the
limestone formation, comprising about 160 acres.&nbsp; It belongs
to F. R. West, Esq., M.P., and the minerals upon it are leased to
the &ldquo;<i>Carreg Hova Copper and Lead Mining
Company</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The limestone rocks, part of which are
900 feet in height, are worked by another Company, and large
quantities of fine limestone are annually raised and sold,
principally for agricultural purposes, in Shropshire and
Montgomeryshire.&nbsp; The ores raised from the hill are
carbonates, sulphurets, and oxides of copper, carbonate of lead,
and calamine (carbonate of zinc).&nbsp; On the north-west side of
the hill are the remains of ancient surface mines, supposed to
have been of Roman origin, and from vitrifications near this
spot, there is no doubt that the Roman miners smelted their
copper there in jars on open hearths.&nbsp; Near these old
workings is an immense cave or level, known in the district by
the name of the <i>Ogo</i>, from the Welsh <i>Ogof</i>&mdash;(a
cave).&nbsp; Its windings are so numerous and intricate, that
many years back the labourers, attempting to explore its mazes,
were bewildered in the effort, and a number of miners, who had
been sent in search of them, discovered them lying prostrate on
the ground, in despair of ever again seeing the light of
day.&nbsp; Skeletons, various utensils, and coins of Constantine
and Vespasian, Antoninus and Faustina, have been found within and
about the <i>Ogo</i>.&nbsp; One of these skeletons <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>had a
battle-axe by its side, and a bracelet of glass beads, like the
druidical rings or beads called <i>glain neidr</i>, (the <i>ova
anguinum</i> of Pliny,) and another with a golden bracelet
encircling the wrist.&nbsp; In 1849 two other skeletons were
found buried in trenches near the <i>Ogo</i>, by the side of one
of which lay a strong battle-axe, formed of mixed metal, but
sharp at the edge.&nbsp; These skeletons were of a very large
size, the bones evidently being those of remarkably tall
men.&nbsp; The late Mr. J. F. M. Dovaston explored the <i>Ogo</i>
several years ago, and declared that none of the paths extend
more than two hundred yards from the entrance.&nbsp; Great
quantities of human bones were found in many parts, especially
where the cavern becomes wide and lofty, and this fact induced
the belief that the place, at some early period, was a refuge in
battle or a depository for the dead.&nbsp; For years it was
commonly believed in the district that this labyrinth
communicated by subterraneous paths with Carreg-Hofa Castle; and
some persons have exercised their imagination so largely as to
declare that, while in the far recesses of the cave, they have
heard the rivers Vyrnwy and Tanat rolling over their heads, and
that the said labyrinth actually leads down to fairy-land!</p>
<p>On the eastern brow of the hill there formerly stood a
Cromlech, measuring seven feet by six, and eighteen inches
thick.&nbsp; It was called by the Welsh people
&ldquo;<i>Bedd-y-Cawr</i>,&rdquo; or the <i>Giant&rsquo;s
Grave</i>; and under it, according to tradition, a giant&rsquo;s
wife was buried, with a golden torques about her neck.&nbsp; To
search for this treasure three brothers named Paine, who lived in
the neighbourhood some years ago, threw down the stone from its
pedestal.</p>
<p>The prospect from Llanymynech Hill is indisputably one of the
finest in the kingdom.&nbsp; On the Welsh side are seen the
summits of mountains, rising in every variety of ridge, the
distant in the softest azure, and the nearer in the most
brilliant verdure, with hanging woods, fertile meadows, and the
brightly-shining rivers, Vyrnwy and Tanat, uniting in the valley
below, and sweeping their sunny waters to join the Severn, under
the <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>abrupt and bold rocks of the Breiddin range of
mountains.&nbsp; At a considerable distance, when enlightened by
the sun, may be seen the glistening water-fall of Pistill
Rhaiadr.&nbsp; Turning towards England the expansive Vale of
Shropshire is seen richly wooded, and profuse in luxurious
vegetation, terminated by the column and spires of Shrewsbury,
the Wrekin, and the far distant hills of Staffordshire and
Cheshire.&nbsp; In a northerly direction the Shropshire Union
Canal is seen glitteringly interlacing the rich meadow land; the
graceful lake at Llynclis peeps out amidst over-shading trees;
and the ancient tower of Oswestry parish church completes the
diversified and enchanting series of landscapes.&nbsp; We lately
heard a visitor from Switzerland, just arrived at Llanymynech
Hill from that far-famed picturesque country, declare that he had
seen nothing in the land of William Tell to compare with the
beauty and grandeur of the scene before him.&nbsp; Enraptured
with the prospects, he enthusiastically exclaimed, as the
celebrated Lord Lyttleton had done on viewing Festiniog Vale,
&ldquo;With the woman one loves, with the friend of one&rsquo;s
heart, and a good library of books, one might pass an age here,
and think it a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the south-west lies Carreg Hofa Hall, formerly the pleasant
retreat of Sir Thomas Jones, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas,
and representative for Shrewsbury in 1660.&nbsp; It came into the
possession of Sir J. T. Tyrwhitt Jones, Bart., Usher of the Black
Rod, and father of the first wife of the late John Mytton, Esq.,
of Halston.&nbsp; Further in the same direction is Pentre Heilyn,
the seat of the Heilyn family, some members of which occupy a
distinguished place in Cambrian biography.&nbsp; Below the
western brow of the hill is Aber Tanat, formerly the seat of the
Tanats, or Tanads, descended from Einion, who took their name
from the river Tanat, near their house, for the same reason as
the Mostyns, the Glynnes, &amp;c., to avoid the redundancy of
<i>Aps</i>.&nbsp; Blodwel, a little farther north, was the
graceful theme of bards and minstrels when Welsh song and music
went joyously hand <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>in hand.&nbsp; Llwyn-y-groes, formerly the seat of the
late John Evans, M.D., (but now of Richard Nightingale Broughton,
Esq.,) viewed also from the hill, claims special notice.&nbsp;
Dr. Evans was popular in the literary world, and his didactic
poem, &ldquo;<i>The Bee</i>,&rdquo; enriched with instructive
notes, philosophical and botanical, is still read with
delight.&nbsp; Dr. Evans was father of the author of
&ldquo;<i>The Rectory of Valehead</i>,&rdquo; a work which
obtained public favour, and still holds its place as a literary
production of high merit.&nbsp; The late Mr. Robert Baugh, of
Llanymynech, was another distinguished parishioner.&nbsp; He
officiated for many years as clerk of the parish, but his talents
as a land surveyor and draughtsman procured for him a high
reputation.&nbsp; His large map of Shropshire, a work honourable
to his talents, is still referred to for its accuracy.</p>
<p>The identification of the Roman encampment at <i>Clawdd
Coch</i>, in the parish of Llanymynech, with the ancient
<i>Mediolanum</i>, is still a disputable point.&nbsp; A learned
antiquary, the Rev. R. W. Evans, Vicar of Heversham (son of the
late Dr. Evans), considers that such identification is clearly
established; and the late Rev. Peter Roberts, who had viewed the
place, &ldquo;would fain insist, in conversation, that it was the
identical spot where Mediolanum once quartered the legions of
ambitious Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late Rev. Walter Davies, no mean
authority on questions of antiquity, paid much attention to the
subject, and after personal inspection of Clawdd Coch, came to
the conclusion that Mediolanum is still among the <i>terr&aelig;
incognit&aelig;</i>.</p>

260</span>LLANFORDA,</h3>
<p>The residence of the Right Hon. Sir Henry Watkin Williams
Wynn, K.C.B. and G.C.H., is situated one mile and a half west of
Oswestry.&nbsp; The original estate was part of the possession of
Einion Evell, Lord of Cynllaeth and Mochnant, from whom it
descended, together with Llwyn-y-Maen, to Ievan Vychan, constable
of Knockin, whose heiress, Agnes, carried it into the family of
the Lloyds, by her marriage with Maurice Lloyd, of whom the Welsh
records give the following account:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The said Maurice Lloyd ab Bleddyn Lloyd,
finding himself much oppressed by the English Laws, did kill one
of the judges and hanged divers other officers on oak trees in
Uch-d&ucirc;las, upon whose conviction his lands and inheritance
in Denbigh-land were escheated to the Crown, and so still remains
for most part to this day, and known by the name of the said
Maurice Lloyd; and he for his safeguard withdrew himself to the
sanctuary of Halston, in the county of Salop, and there betook
himself to the protection of John Fitz-Alan, Lord of Oswestry and
Clunne, and after Earl of Arundel.&nbsp; By the said Earl&rsquo;s
commission he levied a great number of soldiers out of the said
Earl&rsquo;s Lordships and Hundreds in the marches of Wales, and
made the said Maurice Lloyd Captain over them, and the said Earl
of Arundel being then General of the English forces, the King of
England sent them to assist the Emperor in the Holy Warre against
the Turke, in which service, at the scaling of, and entering, the
breach at the siege of Acon, the Emperor&rsquo;s colours were
taken by the enemies, and recovered back by the said Maurice
Lloyd, and brought again by him to the Emperor, in reward of
whose valour and faithful service therein the Emperor gave him
the coat of the house of Austria, only changing the field for his
first coat in his achievements before the parental coat of Hedd
Moelwynog.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bearing thus acquired, and constantly used by his
descendants, was the imperial eagle in a field sable.&nbsp; From
Maurice Lloyd the Llanforda property descended to Richard Lloyd,
who, dying in 1508, divided the <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>estate, and left Llanforda to his
eldest son John, and Llwyn-y-maen to his second son Edward.&nbsp;
Llanforda eventually passed from the hands of this family, Edward
Lloyd, a man of dissolute character, having sold it to the first
Sir William Williams, Speaker of the House of Commons in the two
last Parliaments of Charles II., about the year 1685, in whose
posterity (the Wynnstay family) it has since continued.&nbsp; The
Edward Lloyd just mentioned was father, as we have stated in our
Biographical notices, of the celebrated scholar and antiquary,
Edward Llwyd.&nbsp; There was formerly a church at Llanforda, but
it was suppressed by Rynerus, Bishop of St. Asaph.&nbsp; The
river Morda passes close to the estate.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Wynn is a Privy Councillor, and for twenty-five
years filled the important office of Minister Plenipotentiary to
the Court at Copenhagen.&nbsp; He is also a magistrate for the
county of Salop.</p>
<h3>LLANSILIN</h3>
<p>Is situated in the county of Denbigh, but the parish being on
the confines of Salop, and near to Oswestry, a brief notice here
will not be inappropriate.&nbsp; The parish has numerous
historical associations.&nbsp; It was the birthplace of Morris
Kyffin, the learned translator into Welsh of Bishop
Jewell&rsquo;s Apology; of Charles Edwards, the pious author of
&ldquo;<i>Hanes-y-Fydd</i>,&rdquo; a history of Christianity; of
John Davies, author of &ldquo;Heraldry Displayed;&rdquo; and of
Hugh Morris, the eminent Welsh poet and song-writer.&nbsp;
Glasgoed, a seat of the Kyffins (the last heiress of which
married Sir William Williams, Speaker of the House of Commons),
is now the property of Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart.; and Plasnewydd, an
ancient and pleasant residence, once the property of the Chirk
Castle family, belongs to Thomas Hughes, Esq., who resides
there.&nbsp; The late Rev. Walter Davies contends, in his
historical notice of Llansilin, that Owen Glyndwr &ldquo;was an
inhabitant at least, if not a native of this parish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Pennant makes Sycharth, situated in the valley of the Dee, about
three miles below Corwen, as the mansion of Owen, whilst Mr.
Davies fixes the Sycharth, in the parish of <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Llansilin,
as another of Owen&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;in the
year 1792 I had the curiosity to visit this spot (Sycharth) in
Glyndyfrdwy, and also another place called, and universally known
by the name of Sycharth, in this parish of Llansilin; and when I
returned to Mr. Pennant&rsquo;s volume, I entered in the margin,
opposite the name Sycharth,&mdash;&lsquo;Sycharth, the seat of
Owain Glyndwr, described by Iolo Goch, in his Invitation Poem, is
in the parish of Llansilin, about twelve miles to the south by
east of Glyndyfrdwy.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Davies adds,
&ldquo;As Owain was baron of two townships, no one will deny his
having a seat in each; one on the Dee in Glyndyfrdwy, the other
on the Cynllaeth, in this (Llansilin) parish.&rdquo;&mdash;In the
church there is a fine monument of the first Sir William
Williams, Speaker of the House of Commons.&mdash;The present
Vicar is the Rev. Walter Jones.&mdash;The Poor-rate return for
the present year (1855,) gives the acreage at 13,000; gross
rental, &pound;11,880 13s. 10d.; rateable value assessed to the
relief of the poor, &pound;1,070 16s. 2d.</p>
<h3>LLANYBLODWEL,</h3>
<p>Although now included in the county of Salop, is nevertheless
on the borders of Montgomeryshire, and is in the diocese of St.
Asaph.&nbsp; It is a rectory (<i>cum cap. Morton</i>), dedicated
to St. Michael, and is valued in the King&rsquo;s books at
&pound;39 5s.&nbsp; Patron, the Bishop of St. Asaph.&nbsp; It is
situated six miles from Oswestry, on the east side of the river,
below Abercynllaeth, and above Aber-tanat.&nbsp; In Domesday Book
it is called <i>Bodowan-ham</i>, and in an old deed of the
Fitz-Alans <i>Blodwel</i> (dated in the time of Henry 6th,)
<i>Vawre Villata</i>, which means &ldquo;the village of Great
Blodwel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Welsh etymologists contend that the name of
the place is derived from <i>Blodau</i>, a flower, the spring
there being very early; whilst other writers say that the name
originated in the Saxon &ldquo;blood&rdquo; and
&ldquo;wold,&rdquo; in consequence of the bloody and inhuman
battle fought there between the Mercians and the Cymry (or
Welsh).&nbsp; In this parish is Blodwel-Hall, the deserted seat
of the Tanats, descended from Einion.&nbsp; The <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>heiress of
the house, Jane, married John Matthews, of Court, and the heiress
of the Matthewses, Ursula, married Sir John Bridgman, grandson to
the Lord-Keeper, Sir Orlando, and ancestor to the present Earl of
Bradford, who inherits the estate.&nbsp; The rector of the parish
is the Rev. John Parker, son of the late Thomas Netherton Parker,
Esq., of Sweeney Hall, near Oswestry, and distinguished for his
taste in ecclesiastical architecture and decorations.</p>
<h3>PARK HALL,</h3>
<p>In the parish of Whittington, the residence of Richard Henry
Kinchant, Esq., is situated a little more than a mile east from
Oswestry, and about the same distance from Whittington.&nbsp; It
is one of those ancient timber mansions, few of which are now
remaining in England, perhaps none in so perfect a state of
preservation, and exhibits a fine specimen of the domestic
architecture of bye-gone days.&nbsp; The estate on which it
stands formed a portion, in ages past, of the once extensive and
densely-wooded park appertaining to Whittington Castle, when that
ancient stronghold could boast as its possessors in succession
the powerful baronial families of Tudor Trevor, Peverel, Gwarine
de Metz, and Fitz-Alan.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In those somewhat rare and beautifully-delineated maps of
English counties, by Saxton, published in 1577, it is styled
&ldquo;<i>The Park Hall</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This very singular and
time-honoured structure is presumed to have been built in the
reign of Queen Mary (1553&ndash;8), by Robert ap Howell,
otherwise Robert Powell, the first of that name seated at Park,
son of Howel ap Griffith, of Oswestry, descended from a younger
son of Ievan Vychan, of Abertanat, a junior branch of the royal
line of Powys.&nbsp; It remained in this family until the death
of Thomas Powell, High Sheriff in 1717; his line terminated in an
heiress, Jane Powell, who sold the estate to Sir Francis
Charlton, Bart., of Ludford, in the county of Hereford.&nbsp;
Subsequently this property and that of Blundel Hall, near
Bishop&rsquo;s Castle, became vested in the Kinchant family, by
the marriage of John Quinchant (as the name was then spelt), of
Stone <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>House, near Ludlow, Shropshire, a Captain in the 32nd
Regiment of Infantry, with Emma Charlton, daughter of the
before-mentioned Sir Francis Charlton.&nbsp; By this marriage the
present possessor of Park derives his pedigree from the Princes
of Powys-land.</p>
<p>The house is 126 feet in length, the fa&ccedil;ade presenting
numerous pointed gables, terminating in pinnacles.&nbsp; The
entrance to the Hall is through a porch, and over the original
oak door, which is of considerable thickness, and studded with
large square-headed nails, is the following inscription, carved
on stone, the letters in bold relief:&mdash;&ldquo;Quod tibi
fieri non vis alteri ne feceris.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chimnies, of
solid brick-work, are quadrangular, a small space intervening
between each, and crowned with a heavy mass of masonry uniting
them together, and so placed as to present an angle to each of
the cardinal points: thus formed they have resisted the tempests
of three centuries.&nbsp; The hall is wainscoated, and is 33ft.
long by 23ft. wide: it contains several old family portraits of
the Charlton and Kinchant families.&nbsp; There is an oak table
in it, cut from one plank, resting on massive turned pillars; the
length is 23ft. by 4ft. in width, and 2&frac12; inches thick: at
one end is carved the date&mdash;1581.&nbsp; Over a door in the
hall, leading to the great staircase, the arms of Powell,
Needham, and Corbet, are painted in separate panels, of a
deeply-recessed oak moulding.&nbsp; Thomas Powell, of Park Hall,
who died in 1588, married Mary, daughter of Sir Robert Corbet,
Knight, of Moreton Corbet, and his son, Robert Powell, married
Anne, daughter of Robert Needham, Esq., of Shavington, sister of
the first Viscount Kilmorrey.&nbsp; The large dining-room is
beautifully wainscoated in diamond-shaped panels, and the
mantel-piece is a noble specimen of rich oak carving.&nbsp; It
bears the date 1640, with this motto carved on a
scroll:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Nec vi nec vento</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
Colonel Jones, of Shropshire, engaged with Cromwell&rsquo;s army,
bore this motto on his banner, yet it does not appear that he
ever resided at Park, or was connected <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>with the
Powell family.&nbsp; The ceiling is a fine example of
plaster-work, and, as there appears no date upon it, is probably
coeval with the house.&nbsp; It is ornamented with figures of
birds, horses, and stags, and the central compartment has a
representation in bold relief, of Neptune and his attendant
Tritons.&nbsp; The great staircase, leading to the drawing-room,
long gallery, and bedrooms, is a good specimen of the style of
the 16th century; the balustrade of massive oak, the strong
upright pillars, having pointed finials, are carved with a T like
ornament, such as is of common occurrence on the ancient stone
crosses of Wales.&nbsp; Underneath the window, on the first
landing-place, is carved this sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;Accurate
cogita immutabilia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are also two fine
paintings, the one by Holbein, representing the great reformers,
Luther, Wyckliffe, Melancthon, and others, seated round a table;
the other painting a boar hunt, after Schneider.&nbsp; The upper
rooms are all wainscoated, and abound in elaborately-carved old
oak furniture, some bearing dates early in the 17th
century.&nbsp; The gallery, extending nearly the entire length of
the house, is hung with several old family portraits.&nbsp; There
is a beautiful little chapel abutting on the west wing of the
house; the windows are stained glass, the interior is
wainscoated, and the whole arched over with oak panelling; over
the entrance is carved on stone these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Petra
et ostium Christus est.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a gallery to the
chapel, approached by a door from the drawing-room.&nbsp; On the
south side of the garden is a terrace of considerable length, and
in the centre stands a remarkable sun-dial, in stone, bearing
several Latin inscriptions, alluding to the rapid flight of time:
on the pediment is the date 1578.&nbsp; All the letters and
figures on this stone, and all that are found in various parts
round the house, are carved in relief.&nbsp; This dial fronts the
south, and has no less than seven complete dials on it.&nbsp; On
the terrace are likewise the fragments of several large stones
and dials, bearing inscriptions in Latin.</p>

<h3>PORKINGTON,</h3>
<p>Situated about a mile from Oswestry, to the right of the road
leading to the race-course, is the seat of William Ormsby Gore,
Esquire, M.P. for North Shropshire.&nbsp; This delightful estate
is associated with some of the most interesting incidents in the
history of North Wales, and has for years been viewed as one of
the great land-marks of the chequered history of the Welsh
border.&nbsp; It derives its name from &ldquo;Castell
Brogyntyn,&rdquo; a fortress of the celebrated Owen Brogyntyn, a
natural son of Madog ab Meredydd ab Bleddyn, Prince of half of
Powys, and who, as a gift from his father, enjoyed the title of
Lord of Edeirnion and Dinmael.&nbsp; He flourished in the latter
part of the twelfth century.&nbsp; The site of the ancient fort
still remains in the shrubberies of Porkington, the moat filled
up serving as a gravel walk, surrounded by plantations.&nbsp;
Owen resided at Brogyntyn, whence he assumed his surname.&nbsp;
According to a drawing in the Mytton collection, the fort was of
a circular form, surrounded by a large earthen dyke and a deep
foss, that had two entrances close to each other, projecting a
little from the sides, and diverging, the end of each being
guarded by a semi-lunar curtain.&nbsp; The name of the fortress
and house (for Owen Brogyntyn resided there) was soon altered
into one closely resembling the present, as we find that in 1218
Henry III., in an address to Llywelyn, Prince of Wales, informs
him that, among others, &ldquo;Bleddyn Filius <i>Oeni de
Porkinton</i>&rdquo; had performed the service he owed to the
English Crown.&nbsp; The house was formerly known also by the
name of &ldquo;<i>Constables&rsquo; Hall</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
precise date of the change of name cannot be ascertained.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Porkington is also historically connected with the
distinguished royalist Sir John Owen, of Cleneney,
Caernarvonshire, a man whose history reveals unshaken fidelity to
the unfortunate Charles I., and a courage undaunted amidst the
most trying reverses.&nbsp; A short biography of this eminent man
will not be deemed out of place in these pages.&nbsp; Sir John
Owen was the eldest son of John Owen, Esq. of Cleneney, and was
born in 1600.&nbsp; His father had been secretary to the great
Walsingham, and had amassed in his service a fortune of
&pound;10,000, a large sum in those days.&nbsp; He married Ellen
Maurice, the heiress of Cleneney and Porkington, about
1597.&nbsp; Their son John entered the army, and soon
distinguished himself.&nbsp; At the siege of Bristol he greatly
signalized himself, and was severely wounded in that
engagement.&nbsp; Throughout indeed the wars against the Common
Wealth he proved himself a faithful and valiant commander on
behalf of the king.&nbsp; At the famous battle of Llandegai, near
Bangor, Caernarvonshire, fortune declared against him, and he was
taken prisoner.&nbsp; This victory was considered by the Cromwell
party of so much importance that Captain Taylor, who communicated
the intelligence to Parliament, was rewarded with &pound;200 from
Sir John&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; He was conveyed to Windsor Castle,
where he found incarcerated four of his gallant compatriots,
namely, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Lords
Goring and Capel.&nbsp; All these prisoners were put upon trial,
and Sir John Owen maintained a firm and heroic spirit during the
enquiry that eventually saved his life.&nbsp; On being asked by
the Court for his defence, he said &ldquo;he was a plain
gentleman of Wales who had always been taught to obey the king;
that he had served him honestly during the war; and finding many
honest subjects endeavouring to raise forces whereby they might
get him out of prison, he did the like.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
condemned to lose his head, and at the conclusion of the sentence
he bowed to the Court and gave his humble thanks.&nbsp; A
bye-stander, marking his intrepid conduct, asked him what he
meant, when Sir John replied&mdash;<a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>&ldquo;It was a great honor to a
poor gentleman of Wales to lose his head with such noble lords,
for he was afraid they would have hanged him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Strong
remonstrances were made in Parliament on behalf of the duke and
noble lords, but, finding no one speak in favour of Sir John
Owen, Ireton rose as his advocate, and told the house
&ldquo;there was one person for whom no one spoke a word, and
therefore he requested that he might be saved by the sole motive
and goodness of the house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ireton&rsquo;s appeal was
effectual, and Sir John was pardoned after a few months&rsquo;
imprisonment, and permitted to return to his native
country.&nbsp; He died in 1666, and was buried in Penmorfa
Church, Caernarvonshire, where a monument is erected to his
memory.&nbsp; The estates of Sir John Owen are possessed by his
lineal descendant, Mrs. Ormsby Gore, and many interesting relics
of the gallant knight are preserved at Porkington.&nbsp; Among
these are his official seal as Vice Admiral of North Wales, and a
sword given him by Lord Capel with the following
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Capel, the day before his
execution, presented this sword to Sir John Owen, by whom, he
said, he was convinced it would be worn with honour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His portrait is also preserved at Porkington, from which the
engraving, in Pennant&rsquo;s quarto edition of his tours, was
made.</p>
<p>Porkington is chiefly indebted to the wife of Mr. Ormsby Gore
(daughter and heiress of Owen Ormsby, Esq., who married the
daughter of William Owen, Esq., and Mary Godolphin), for its
present beautiful appearance.&nbsp; The mansion having been built
at three several periods presented a confused mass, until the
alterations made by Miss Ormsby conferred on it a correct Grecian
elevation.&nbsp; The present worthy owner assumed on his marriage
the name of Ormsby, prefixed to his own, and has added largely to
the demesne, and to the well-timbered and romantic appearance of
the hills which environ the rear of the building, the sight from
the north-east and south giving extensive views over the counties
of Denbigh, Chester, and Salop.</p>
<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>On
the pediment of the portico are the arms of the present
possessors in <i>alto-relievo</i>.&nbsp; The principal stair-case
is lighted by a dome of stained glass, exhibiting the names and
arms of different proprietors, with the dates of their occupancy,
and the names and arms also of various heiresses connected
therewith, namely, Laken, Maurice, Owen, Anwyl, Wynne, Godolphin,
Ormsby and Gore.&nbsp; The reception rooms are furnished with
remarkable elegance and taste.&nbsp; In the saloon is the
full-length portrait of Mrs. Siddons, a singularly-faithful
likeness, and also a curious painting on panel, being the only
portion saved of the Altar-piece of Valle Crucis Abbey.</p>
<p>The views from the Terrace at Porkington are extensive and
highly picturesque, displaying a variety of rich landscape
scenery.&nbsp; In the foreground (now attached to the Porkington
estate) is <i>Old Oswestry</i>, the <i>Hen Dinas</i> of the
Welsh, (and in still more ancient periods Caer Ogyr-fan, from
Ogyr-fan, a hero contemporary with Arthur,) a densely wooded
hill, and supposed to have been a strong fortification of British
or Roman origin.&nbsp; It is situated on the range of
Watts&rsquo; Dyke, which served as a boundary to the neutral
ground on the Welsh side.&nbsp; It is surrounded by three deep
entrenchments, one above the other, in which are two passes,
north and south, to ascend to a very extended plain on the top of
the whole, encompassed with fortifications &amp;c., comprising
upwards of forty-two acres of land.&nbsp; The sides of the
entrenchments are closely wooded, and carefully preserved by Mr.
Ormsby Gore, who has also planted an adjacent hill on the other
side of the valley.</p>
<p>The parish of Selattyn, in which Porkington stands, is divided
into two townships, deriving their names from the same source,
namely, <i>Upper Porkington</i> and <i>Lower Porkington</i>.</p>
<h3>SELATTYN &amp; HENGOED.</h3>
<h4>SELATTYN,</h4>
<p>Or Sylattin, is a parish in the upper division of Oswestry, a
rectory remaining in charge, in the diocese of St. Asaph and <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>the deanery
of Marchia.&nbsp; The village is situated about two miles from
the Great Western Railway Station at Preesgwene, and three miles
north-west of Oswestry.&nbsp; The population of the parish has
greatly increased within the last forty years, much land,
hitherto waste, has been brought into a profitable state of
cultivation, and many neat and convenient cottages have been
built.&nbsp; During the long residence in the parish of the late
Rev. G. N. K. Lloyd, rector, who died in his sixtieth year, on
the 17th January, 1846, the social condition of his parishioners
was greatly improved, as he was constantly engaged for their
benefit in every &ldquo;good word and work.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
October 1846 a water-ram was erected at the expense of his
nephew, the Rev. Albany R. Lloyd; by which means the water is
forced up, from a fine spring some distance off, to the rectory,
and on towards the village, for the convenience and comfort of
the inhabitants.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The village is romantically situated.&nbsp; The church and
school, the small collection of dwellings, with the little <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>picturesque
valley leading to it, and the brook, which empties itself into
the Morlas, rolling its limpid stream over a rocky and pebbly
bed, are all delightful features of the scene.&nbsp; In the
church-yard some beautiful and aged ash-trees expand their
immense arms over the precipice beneath, while a noble avenue of
lime trees adorns the northern side, and several lofty firs
enrich the southern.&nbsp; There are also several ancient yews,
which add solemnity to this interesting spot.&nbsp; On the hills
above Selattyn are two large carneddu, with lesser ones near to
them.</p>
<p>The erection of the steeple of the church was commenced upon
in 1703.&nbsp; In 1821 a north transept was added to the fabric,
and in 1828 the south transept was built.&nbsp; A new organ,
built by Bryceson, was placed in the church in 1847.</p>
<p>A whimsical derivation of the name of the place is given by
the late John Davies, Esq., Recorder of Oswestry:&mdash;&ldquo;A
schoolmaster having set up here, and finding that few pupils
attended, imagined that people did not know of him, but passed on
to Oswestry, wrote over his door, &lsquo;I sell
Latin!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether this was veritably the origin
of the name we are unable to prove, but, as Mr. Davies adds,
&ldquo;if not the best, it is not worse than some derivations
which may be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We subjoin a list of the rectors of the parish since 1537,
including the appointment of the fiery meteor Sacheverell, whose
career we have noticed in preceding pages:&mdash;</p>

<h4>HENGOED,</h4>
<p>In the parish of Selattyn, is situated about two miles north
of Oswestry, and has derived much interest from the recent
erection of a neat and convenient church, dedicated to St.
Barnabas, built chiefly at the expense of the Rev. Albany
Rossendale Lloyd, the present much-respected Incumbent, aided by
a few subscriptions.&nbsp; The foundation-stone was laid by the
Rev. A. R. Lloyd, Aug. 16th, 1849; the church was opened for
divine service June 11, 1850; and was consecrated by the Right
Rev. Dr. Thomas Voule, Bishop of St. Asaph, August 15th,
1853.&nbsp; A district, with a population of about 650 persons,
has been legally assigned to this church, and was duly gazetted
January 31st, 1854.&nbsp; An excellent Sunday-school is attached
to the church, and was originally used, until the present church
was completed, as a place for divine worship.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The amount rated to the poor for the parish of Selattyn, for
the year ending 25th March, 1855, was 1s. 3d. in the pound.&nbsp;
The annual rental of the land and buildings is fixed at
&pound;6,974; rateable value, &pound;6,501 6s. 8d.; and the
estimated extent of acreage, 5,434a. 3r. 13p.</p>
<h3>ST. MARTIN&rsquo;S</h3>
<p>Is a parish situated about five miles from, and in the hundred
of Oswestry.&nbsp; It is a vicarage discharged, in the diocese of
St. Asaph, and deanery of Marchia.&nbsp; The great tithes were <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>given by
one of the Fitz-Alans to the Monastery of Oswestry,
<i>Album-Monasterium</i>.&nbsp; They afterwards became the
property of the Duke of Powis, and now belong in part to Viscount
Dungannon.&nbsp; The living is a vicarage, and is valued at
&pound;9 8s. 8d., but, having received Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty,
is discharged from payments.&nbsp; The church is dedicated to St.
Martin.&nbsp; The tower is a handsome building of freestone, but
the body of the church is of rubble stone, and very inferior in
appearance.&nbsp; In 1811 the church was new pewed, when a
gallery was also erected, and the same year the late Lord
Dungannon made a present of an organ.&nbsp; In the roof of the
chancel were several beautiful wood-carved images, but they were
destroyed by some merciless churchwarden.&nbsp; The Bishop of St.
Asaph had a palace here, but Owen Glyndwr burnt it when he laid
waste the county of Salop.&nbsp; In the Mostyn library is a Welsh
manuscript on parchment, of the life of St. Martin.&nbsp; It was
translated from the Latin by John Trevor, a writer who flourished
between 1430 and 1470.&nbsp; In the parish are two schools, one
founded by William ab Royd, Merchant Taylor, for fifteen poor
children, and the other by the late Viscountess Dungannon, on the
Lancasterian plan, for twenty poor girls.&nbsp; The poor-rate
return for the year 1855 shows that the acreage of the parish is
5,315; the gross rental, &pound;10,016 13s. 9d.; and the rateable
value, &pound;9,534 4s. 3d.&nbsp; The present Vicar is the Rev.
William Hurst.</p>
<p>In the village called <i>The Lodge</i>, in this parish, a
school was erected in the year 1851, and has been productive of
much good among the humbler portion of the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the parish of St. Martin&rsquo;s there are several
beautiful residences, among which may be enumerated
<i>Preesgwene</i>, <i>The Quinta</i>, <i>Tyn-y-Rhos</i>, and
<i>Greenfield Lodge</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Preesgwene House</span> is historically
connected with the Border Lands.&nbsp; It is the property and
residence of J. R. Powell, Esq., is a neat mansion, embosomed in
rich foliage, <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>and situated four and a half miles from Oswestry.&nbsp;
The house was built in the sixteenth century, by E. Phillips,
Esq., an ancestor of the present possessor.&nbsp; The Rev. Robert
Williams, in his &ldquo;<i>Biographical Dictionary of Eminent
Welshmen</i>,&rdquo; states that &ldquo;Gw&ecirc;n, the most
valiant of the twenty-four sons of Llywarch H&ecirc;n, was slain
on the ford of Morlas, a brook which rises in Selattyn mountain,
near Oswestry, and flows into the Ceiriog.&nbsp; The name of
Gw&ecirc;n is preserved in Prys Gw&ecirc;n, a gentleman&rsquo;s
residence near the Morlas, in the parish of St.
Martin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Llywarch H&ecirc;n is said to have
died in the parish of Llanvor, near Bala, where a secluded place
called <i>Pabell</i>, or the cot of Llywarch H&ecirc;n, is still
pointed out.&nbsp; He was a British Prince by birth, and a
distinguished bard, as already stated.&nbsp; [See pp. <span

<p><span class="smcap">The Quinta</span> was for many years the
residence of the late Hon. Frederick West, (a gentleman whose
virtues and honour endeared him to all who had the privilege of
his acquaintance,) by whom it was greatly improved.&nbsp; This
delightful estate was purchased by Thomas Barnes, Esq., M.P., for
Bolton, Lancashire, one of the most successful manufacturers of
that county.&nbsp; In his hands the property has undergone still
further improvements.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tyn-y-Rhos</span>, the seat of the Rev.

class="smcap">Pradoe</span>, the seat of the Hon. Mrs. Kenyon
(widow of the late Hon. <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Thomas Kenyon, third son of Chief
Justice Lord Kenyon); <span class="smcap">Woodhouse</span>, the
fine old mansion of W. Mostyn Owen, Esq.; <span

Owen, Esq.; and &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
Nursery</span>,&rdquo; formerly the residence of J. F. M.
Dovaston, Esq., but now possessed by John Dovaston, Esq., the
inheritor of the Poet&rsquo;s estates.&nbsp; The parish church is
dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, and is of great
antiquity, the nave being of Norman date.&nbsp; Within the last
few years a new aisle on the north side, in the early English
style, has been erected.&nbsp; At the east end of it there is an
elegant triplet filled with stained glass of early English
character, displaying scriptural subjects in medallions.&nbsp;
Other improvements have been made in the church from designs by
Mr. G. G. Scott.&nbsp; Near Haughton, in this parish, large
quantities of earthenware have been discovered, of various
colours, blue, red, green, and yellow, and highly glazed.&nbsp;
Their origin or purpose remains a mystery, but is still worthy of
antiquarian investigation.&nbsp; Sandford Hall, in this parish,
was formerly the residence of the celebrated &ldquo;Bumper Squire
Jones,&rdquo; the hero of the once popular song of that name.</p>
<p>The present rector is the Rev. T. Hunt.&nbsp; According to the
poor-rate return for 1855 the acreage of the parish is 5,989
acres 2 roods; the gross rental &pound;10,048 10s.; and the
rateable value assessed to the relief of the poor, &pound;7,948

<h3>WHITTINGTON,</h3>
<p>Is a charming village, possessing all the beauties which give
pleasure to the lovers of inland rustic scenery.&nbsp;
Picturesque cottages, neat dwellings for people in retired
circumstances, good-looking farmers&rsquo; homesteads, the
village church, in silent repose, surrounded by its grave-yard,
and finally, the vestiges of its ancient Castle, once the
baronial and stately residence of the renowned Norman Chief
Fitz-Gwarine, and the scene of many a romantic story, give to
Whittington village a lively interest in which all who can
leisurely view it must <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>participate.&nbsp; It is situated
upon the turnpike-road from Oswestry to Ellesmere, and two and
a-half miles from the former, and five and a-half from the
latter.&nbsp; The Great Western Railway passes through the
village, where there is also a station, the trains stopping there
several times a day.</p>
<p>Its antiquity extends so far back as the year 590, when, as
the Welsh poet Llywarch H&ecirc;n states, it was known by the
name of the <i>White Town</i> (Drev-Wen.)&nbsp; In the reign of
Rhodri Mawr (Roderick the Great,) king of all Wales, A.D. 843, a
British Chieftain (Ynyr ab Cadfarch) built the Castle, which was
afterwards possessed by his son, Tudor Trevor, subsequently Earl
of Hereford.&nbsp; Tudor Trevor&rsquo;s mother was grand-daughter
to Caradog Vreichvas, who fell in the memorable battle at
Rhuddlan Marsh, A.D. 795.&nbsp; The descendants of Tudor
continued in possession of the Castle for many generations, and
several of the leading families in North Wales can trace their
origin to him.&nbsp; At the conquest Whittington became the
property of Pain Peverel, and afterwards of Roger, Earl of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The Castle and lordship next passed into the
hands of Hugh, and subsequently of Robert, both sons of Roger,
the before-named Earl.&nbsp; On the defeat and forfeiture of
Robert, by an Act of Henry I., the property was restored to the
Peverels, in the person of Sir William Peverel, distinguished for
his noble and valiant enterprises.&nbsp; He had two daughters;
the youngest, named Mellet, of martial spirit, resolved to wed no
one but the knight greatest in valour, and her father published
this declaration, promising Whittington Castle as her
dower.&nbsp; This announcement attracted the attention of many a
gallant youth, and soon afterwards Peverel&rsquo;s domain at the
Peak, near Castleton, Derbyshire, was the scene of contention for
the fair prize.&nbsp; Among the combatants were a son of the King
of Scotland, the Baron Burgoyne, and a noble Lorrainer, Gwarine
de Metz, (Sheriff of Shropshire, and chief Counsellor to the Earl
of Shrewsbury,) the latter of whom appeared with a shield of <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>silver, and
a proud peacock on his crest!&nbsp; To him the spirited Mellet
was sincere, he having been declared victor.&nbsp; The son of
this chivalrous pair was &ldquo;famed for deeds of arms,&rdquo;
and their posterity, for nine generations, assumed the christian
name of Fulk, and the common name of Fitz-Gwarine.&nbsp; The
Castle of Whittington was possessed by the family from the end of
the reign of Henry I. till the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Gwarine
de Metz died in the reign of Henry I. at Alberbury, the Abbey of
which place he had founded, and there he was interred, his wife,
the famous Mellet Peverel, and her son, the first Fulk
Fitz-Gwarine, being present on the affecting occasion.</p>
<p>This youth was as distinguished, in the arts of love and war,
as his father.&nbsp; He became desperately enamoured with Hawys,
the daughter of Sir Joos, of Normandy; rescued the father from
impending death, while in the hands of Walter Lacy and Sir Arnold
de Lis, two inveterate enemies, and, as a reward for his
gallantry and courage, received the hand in marriage of his
beloved Hawys.&nbsp; Fulk Fitz-Gwarine was heroic in all his
achievements, was knighted by Henry I., made steward of the
King&rsquo;s Household, and Lieutenant of the Marches.&nbsp; In a
skirmish with the Welsh, under Grufydd ab Cynan, he was defeated,
and Whittington Castle fell into their hands.&nbsp; In the reign
of Henry II. peace was made with Owen Gwynedd, the succeeding
Prince of North Wales: the Castle was retained by Owen; and as
some compensation for his loss, Fulk had the manor of Alston, in
Gloucestershire, bestowed upon him.&nbsp; It is recorded, says
the Rev. W. Davies, in his interesting &ldquo;History of
Whittington,&rdquo; that &ldquo;Fulk Fitz-Gwarine, and John, son
to Henry II. (afterwards King John,) were playing at chess
together, when it happened that they disagreed, and the Prince
gave Fulk a severe blow upon the head with the board, which the
latter returned in such a violent manner as almost to kill the
young Prince, a circumstance, had it happened, not much to be
regretted, were it not in consideration of the glorious Magna
Charta afterwards <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>obtained from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dovaston, in his fine
descriptive poem, entitled &ldquo;Fitz-Gwarine,&rdquo; makes his
hero describe the quarrel in the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Enough to name our last affray,<br />
The Prince his temper lost at play,<br />
The chess-board swung with coward sway,<br />
And hurl&rsquo;d my head upon;<br />
Ill could the wrong my bosom brook,<br />
I sent him first a furious look,<br />
Then firm with knuckles clench&rsquo;d I strook<br />
The pate of royal John.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fulk Fitz-Gwarine was succeeded by his eldest son, who bore
the same name, and eclipsed his father by the brilliancy and
skill of his military enterprises.&nbsp; He accompanied Richard
I. in the Crusades, and was made Lord Marcher of Wales.&nbsp; At
the commencement of King John&rsquo;s reign Whittington was in
the hands of Maurice, brother to the Roger to whom Owen Gwynedd
had presented it.&nbsp; Fulk Fitz-Gwarine applied to John for the
restoration of the ancient property of his ancestors; but John
rejected his application.&nbsp; Indignant at this treatment Fulk
joined the Welsh sovereign, made battle against Maurice, in which
the latter was slain.&nbsp; The English King determined upon
having Fulk Fitz-Gwarine put to death, but the latter fled to
France, under the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Sir Amice, a wandering
knight, and was so much admired by the French monarch for his
honourable and chivalrous conduct, that he tendered to him a
barony of France.&nbsp; After having performed many acts of
valour and renown in France, Fulk returned to England, determined
to see King John and propitiate his favour.&nbsp; Fearing
discovery, he exchanged clothes with a peasant, and wended his
way to Windsor, to confront the monarch.&nbsp; In Windsor Forest
they both met, John being out hunting, and Fulk appearing before
the King as a peasant.&nbsp; Fulk made known to him his errand,
and declared that he was the obnoxious Fitz-Gwarine; with the
courage and dignity of his race he menaced the king for the
unjust treatment he had received, and forced him to restore to
his undisturbed <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>possession the Castle and lordship of Whittington, his
ancestral property.&nbsp; John immediately repudiated his grant,
and Fulk was again compelled to leave the kingdom, having been
pursued by emissaries of the monarch, charged to slay him.&nbsp;
Fitz-Gwarine was still as adroit as he was brave; he killed the
man who meditated his assassination, fled to Orkney, where he
released a persecuted female from her captivity, and won a
hauberk of hard steel, which, with other ancient pieces of armour
belonging to his family, hung, till Cromwell&rsquo;s wars, in the
church of Whittington.&nbsp; From Orkney Fulk sailed to Carthage,
where he derived much information, his patriotism was inflamed,
and where also his enthusiastic desire for the improvement of his
native country glowed with increased ardour.&nbsp; Wrapt in these
visions of future glory and happiness, he re-embarked for
England, arrived safely, appealed again to King John, obtained
pardon for all past offences, and with it the restoration of
Whittington Castle and all its appendages.&nbsp; Thus once more
in possession of his ancient halls, he lived in the state and
hospitality which became his princely condition.&nbsp; Then, as
the author of &ldquo;Fitz-Gwarine&rdquo; so sweetly
sings&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other guests than yon lone bird,<br />
And other music here were heard,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In times of better days;<br />
Festive revelry went round,<br />
The board with blushing goblets crown&rsquo;d,<br />
And costly carpets clad the ground,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where now yon cattle graze.<br />
Days were those of splendour high,<br />
Days of hospitality,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When to his rich domain<br />
Welcom&rsquo;d many a crested knight,<br />
Welcom&rsquo;d many a lady bright,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fitz-Gwarine of Lorraine!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This remarkable man was afterwards sent by the English King to
Ireland on an important service, and was distinguished on his
return, with the title of <span class="smcap">The
Great</span>.&nbsp; He subsequently united with the English
Barons in their memorable demand <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>from King John of Magna Charta, and
so resolute was his conduct on that great occasion at Runnymede,
that the Pope actually conferred upon him the honour of
excommunication from the papal church.</p>
<p>After various other conflicts and disasters, &ldquo;by flood
and field,&rdquo; he descended into old age, when he was stricken
with blindness.&nbsp; He was buried in the porch of Whittington
Church, and his remains were found there in an oak coffin, three
inches in thickness, by digging a grave in the year 1796.&nbsp;
He left behind him a son who enjoyed his father&rsquo;s estates
and titles, but for no considerable time.&nbsp; He followed Henry
III. through all his adverse fortunes, and whilst engaged at the
battle of Lewes was drowned in crossing a river, leaving behind
him a young son, the fourth Fitz-Gwarine.</p>
<p>Fitz-Gwarine the second was married to Clarice of Abbourville,
and he went generally by the peculiar appellation of
<i>Proud-homme</i>, as a mark of respect to his nobility.</p>
<p>Whittington Castle, after the battle of Lewes, was bestowed by
the Earl of Leicester upon Peter de Montford.&nbsp; Leicester
also compelled the captive king Richard II. to deliver it, with
other Border Castles, into the hands of Llywelyn ab Grufydd,
Prince of Wales, who had just received the entire sovereignty of
Wales, and required homage from all the barons under him.</p>
<p>The subsequent history of the Fitz-Gwarines presents but few
interesting features.&nbsp; This illustrious race became extinct
at the death of Henry, fifth Earl of Bath (who inherited the
title of Fitz-Gwarine through the marriage of Elizabeth, sister
and heiress to Fulk the <i>ninth</i>, with Richard Haukford,
Esq.,) and the manor, after various transfers in succeeding ages,
was purchased by Francis (or William) Albany, Esq., of London,
from one of the Earls of Arundel, it having been granted to him
by Queen Mary, but afterwards mortgaged and sold.&nbsp; The
manor, advowsons, and estate of Fernhill passed subsequently to
the house of Aston, by the marriage of <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Sarah,
daughter and heiress of the said Francis Albany, Esq., to Thomas
Lloyd, Esq., of Aston.&nbsp; In the year 1760 the eastern tower
of the Castle fell into the moat after a severe frost, and some
years afterwards one of the northern towers and the western wall
were taken down to repair, it is said, the road leading from
Whittington to Halston bridge.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The remains of the Castle are still a picturesque ruin, which
attracts artists from all parts of the kingdom to sketch its
lingering beauties.&nbsp; Our own artist has done justice to the
Castle in the sketch he has taken.&nbsp; The towers of the
gate-house are still entire, and part of the ancient building is
converted into a dwelling, and occupied by Thomas Broughall,
Esq.&nbsp; A running brook passes through the moat, which is
overhung with fine old trees, casting their shade upon the
waters.&nbsp; In the year 1796 three curious bottles, richly
gilt, were found, and subsequently, in clearing the bottom of one
of the old towers, some huge iron fetters, a gyve of ponderous
size, with a number of the heads and antlers of deer.&nbsp; The
Castle, from its position on the frontier of Wales, and from the
warlike spirit of its lords, was in feudal times a place of great
consequence, and, like other border fortresses, alternately the
scene of clashing arms and knightly festivity.</p>
<p>The church, which is dedicated to St. John, is a rectory in
the archdeaconry and diocese of St. Asaph, and was originally
designed as a chapel to the castle.&nbsp; The body of the church
was rebuilt in 1805, from a design by the late Mr. Thomas
Harrison, architect, of Chester.&nbsp; It is a large brick
building of 60 feet by 50, and cost &pound;1500.&nbsp; To lessen
the expense of building the church two briefs were procured that
raised &pound;703 15s. 1d., but of this sum only &pound;42 2s.
1d. was received.&nbsp; In 1810 a new organ was erected in the
church.&nbsp; In the same year the church-yard wall, being much
out of repair, was rebuilt with stone.&nbsp; The Rev. Charles
Arthur Albany Lloyd, who had filled the office of Rector for many
years, died July 24th, 1851, he being also Rector of Selattyn at
the time.</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>Whittington parish is divided into nine townships,
namely,&mdash;Whittington to the south; Berghill and Francton (or
Frankton) to the east; old Marton (or Martin), Hindford, Henlle,
and Ebnall, to the north; and Fernhill and Daywell to the
west.</p>
<p>In a manuscript description of the parish we find the
following derivation of names:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span class="smcap">Whittington</span>, or
White Town, from White Castle, in Welsh, <i>Drewen</i>.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span
class="smcap">Berghill</span>&mdash;Welsh, <i>Byr-Ghill</i>, or
Short Hazles.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span class="smcap">Hindford</span>&mdash;,,
<i>Hen-fordd</i>, or The Old Road.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span class="smcap">Henlle</span>&mdash;,,
<i>Hen</i>, old, and <i>Lle</i>, Place.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span class="smcap">Daywell</span>&mdash;,,
<i>Fynnon du</i>, or <i>dydd</i>.&nbsp; Day Spring (or well).</p>
<p class="gutlist"><span class="smcap">Fernhill</span>&mdash;,,
<i>Fwrn</i> and <i>Oven</i>, or Hole and Hill.</p>
<p>A tradition long prevailed in the village, that it was the
birth-place of the renowned Sir Richard Whittington,
&ldquo;thrice Lord Mayor of London town.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is now,
however, generally understood that he was born in the township of
Newnes, (not far from Whittington,) about one mile north-west of
Ellesmere.&nbsp; Shropshire claims him for her own; and if
Whittington really was &ldquo;a proud Salopian,&rdquo; the county
has a right to be proud of the honour of enrolling among its
worthies so distinguished a name.&nbsp; Another vague tradition
prevailed, that the well-known metrical tale of &ldquo;<i>The
Babes in the Wood</i>&rdquo; derives its origin from
<i>Babins&rsquo; wood</i>, (commonly called <i>Babbys&rsquo;
wood</i>,) near Whittington.&nbsp; The tradition adds, that the
murder of the two children by their cruel uncle was perpetrated
at this place.&nbsp; Gough, the historian of Middle, relates
particulars of the murder of a child by its uncle, but his
account is only from tradition, and therefore mixed up with much
error.</p>
<p>The version we now give of this murder, derived from an
authentic source, shews that the ballad of the <i>Babes in the
</i><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span><i>Wood</i> could not have been founded upon it.&nbsp;
The scene of the nursery rhyme is laid in Norfolk, and all the
circumstances it details differ materially from those of the
murder at Knockin heath.&nbsp; The version we have is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1590, 27th March.&mdash;A man and woman
were executed at Knockin heath, for murdering a child of the age
of five years, for his land, being an heir of &pound;5 a-year, or
thereabout, which fell after the said child&rsquo;s death, if he
died without issue, to his uncles, being three of them, which
uncles procured and imagined the death of the said child ever
since his birth.&nbsp; Two of the uncles were executed at
Bridgenorth assizes, and the third <i>pressed</i> to death
there.&nbsp; But the woman being grandmother to the child, and
the man named Geffrey Elkes, being hired to do the deed, were
executed at the said heath where the said deed was
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Elkes, at his execution, affirmed that
he did not kill the child, but brought a pail of water to the
heath, and left it there with the child and the uncle that was
<i>pressed</i> to death, but he confessed that before the deed
was done, and after, two ravens usually would meet him, follow
him, and cry about him; and when he escaped and hid himself, the
said ravens did cry, and flew about the place, and descried him
out, and he was found in a cock of hay by their means.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parish register is a curious record of odds and ends, and
from it we make a few quaint selections:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Died March 11th, 1767.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Thomas Evans</span>, parish clerk, aged 72.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Sternhold&rsquo;s lines, or Vicar of Bray,<br />

<p>I do make choice of William Evans, his son, to serve the
office of parish clerk, being qualified according to the 91st
canon, viz: above twenty years of age, and of an honest
conversation, and very sufficient for his reading, writing, and
also for his competent skill in singing, tho&rsquo; not so clever
a piper as his father.&nbsp; This choice was signified to the
parishioners in time of divine service, on Sunday, the 15th day
of March, 1767.</p>

<p>There are several useful and important charities pertaining to
Whittington parish.&nbsp; Jones&rsquo;s charity of 1670, and
Griffith Hughes&rsquo;s bequest in 1706, provide for the
education of the <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>boys of the parish, as that of Elizabeth Probert does
for the girls.&nbsp; These bequests are now applied to the
National Schools established in the village.</p>
<p>The old National Schools being too small for the increasing
population of the parish, a new School House, for the
accommodation of Boys and Girls, was erected in the year 1853, on
the site of the former Boys&rsquo; School, at a cost of
&pound;900, after a design by Messrs W. and J. Morris, Builders,
&amp;c., of Oswestry, by whom also the structure was
erected.&nbsp; The present much-respected Rector is the Rev.
William Walsham How, who purchased the living in the life-time,
and succeeded to it on the death, of the Rev. C. A. A. Lloyd.</p>
<p>The parish of Whittington contains 8,303a. 3r. 10p.; gross
rental, &pound;13,145 5s. 0d.; rateable value, &pound;12,867 10s.
0d.</p>
<p>It is worthy of record in our notice of Whittington, that the
admirable Missionary Hymn, from the pen of the late Bishop Heber,
&ldquo;From Greenland&rsquo;s icy mountains,&rdquo; was written
especially for a public meeting of the friends of Missions, held
in the village about the year 1820, at which the poet Heber
attended.&nbsp; The hymn was sung on that occasion for the first
time; but since then how many thousand voices, in every part of
the habitable globe, have been raised in tuneful melodies whilst
pouring forth this immortal strain!&nbsp; Heber&rsquo;s hymn
ranks with the sacred songs of our best poets, and has urged many
a Christian heart to the heaven-born work of spreading the gospel
throughout the heathen world.</p>
<p>Amongst the pleasant retreats in the neighbourhood of
Whittington are <span class="smcap">Belmont</span>, the residence
of J. V. Lovett, Esq., an active and intelligent Magistrate for

286</span>WYNNSTAY,</h3>
<p>The beautiful seat of Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart., M.P. for
Denbighshire, is within twenty minutes&rsquo; railway ride from
Oswestry.&nbsp; The talent, wealth, and princely hospitality of
the Wynnstay family have given to this mansion and its extensive
domains a national celebrity.&nbsp; The late Sir W. W. Wynn
(father of the present worthy baronet) did much to maintain the
high character for hospitality and munificent liberality for
which the House of Wynnstay has ever been distinguished, and his
memory is embalmed in grateful recollections by hundreds who
partook of his bounty and were generously aided by his purse and
patronage.</p>
<p>Wynnstay is situated in the parish of Rhuabon, and is erected
on the site of a residence of Madog ab Grufydd Maelor, Prince of
Powys, and founder of the abbey of Llanegwest, or Valle Crucis,
near Llangollen.&nbsp; The original name of this house was
<i>Rhuabon</i>.&nbsp; It was the property of Edward Eyton, Esq.,
whose daughter Mary, the heiress, married Richard Evans, Esq.,
son of Thomas Evans, Esq., of Oswestry, attorney-general in the
Court of the Marches.&nbsp; Their grandson, Eyton Evans, (son of
Thomas, son of Richard,) altered the name to <i>Watt</i>-stay, on
account of its proximity to Watts&rsquo; Dyke; and Jane, sole
daughter and heiress of Eyton Evans, Esq., married Sir John Wynn,
who again changed the name to <i>Wynnstay</i>, in compliment to
his own family, he being grandson of Sir John Wynn, of Gwydir, by
his tenth son, Henry, representative for Merionethshire.&nbsp;
The above-named Sir John Wynn, of Wynnstay, left that and other
estates of great value to his kinsman, the first Sir Watkin
Williams Wynn, grandson of Sir William Williams, Speaker of the
House of Commons in the reign of Charles II., and in the early
part of his career Recorder of Chester.&nbsp; Sir William was one
of the most successful lawyers of his time, and was a zealous and
eloquent advocate of the popular party in Charles&rsquo;s
reign.&nbsp; The notorious Jeffreys was reprimanded, on his
knees, by him <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>whilst he was Speaker of the House of Commons; who also
conducted the prosecution of the Seven Bishops, when
solicitor-general; and the &ldquo;Treating Act,&rdquo; which
still continues one of the safeguards of the purity and
independence of Parliament, was introduced by him in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; This celebrated lawyer was made a baronet in
1688.&nbsp; He married Margaret, daughter and heiress of Watkin
Kyffin, Esq., of Glascoed, in the parish of Llansilin, near
Oswestry.&nbsp; He left two sons, and the elder, Sir William, of
Llanforda, married another great heiress, Jane, the daughter of
Edward Thelwall, Esq., of Plas-y-ward, and was father, as already
mentioned, of the first Sir Watkin Williams Wynn.&nbsp; The
Speaker&rsquo;s youngest son, John, was an eminent provincial
lawyer, and practised at Chester, and was direct progenitor of
the present Sir John Williams, of Bodelwyddan, Flintshire.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The mansion is a noble pile of building, of fine white stone,
and has, recently, under the direction of the present possessor
of Wynnstay, undergone much improvement.&nbsp; The interior
comprises several noble apartments, which are embellished with
paintings by the first masters, portraits of various members of
the family, and busts by eminent sculptors, of the distinguished
statesmen Lord Grenville, William Pitt, &amp;c.&nbsp; The library
consists of a fine collection of books, in ancient and modern
literature, with valuable MSS. illustrative of early British
history.&nbsp; Among the variety of plate, including elegant
race-cups, &amp;c., is a large silver vase, or punch-bowl,
presented to the late Sir W. W. Wynn, by his countrymen, on his
return from the battle of Waterloo.</p>
<p>The grounds in which the house is situated are remarkable for
their sylvan beauty.&nbsp; The avenue leading to the mansion from
Rhuabon is formed of fine oak, elm, beech, and other trees, one
of which, &ldquo;The King,&rdquo; measuring thirty feet in
circumference, and with its outspreading arms appearing to bid
defiance to its fellows, seems to have a just claim to the
monarchical title it bears.&nbsp; A fine sheet of water in front
of <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>the
house adds much to the picturesque and deeply-wooded scenery
around.&nbsp; Both the near and distant views from the park are
distinct and attractive, those especially towards the Berwyn
chain of mountains, with the grand breach in it beyond
Llangollen, through which rolls the rapid Dee.&nbsp; An obelisk
or handsome free-stone column is erected in the park, after a
design by Wyatt, as a tribute of maternal affection, in memory of
Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, grandfather of the present
baronet.&nbsp; Round the entablature is a gallery, with a
circular iron balustrade, nine feet high, in the centre of which
stands a handsome urn in bronze.&nbsp; The plinth is wreathed
with oak leaves descending from the beaks of eagles.&nbsp; A
door-way leads, by a wide stair-case, to a gallery at the
top.&nbsp; On the lower part of the Cenotaph is the following
emphatic inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Filio Optimo</span>.<br
/>
<span class="smcap">Mater cheu! superstes</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this column cannot be seen from the house, a glimpse
of it may be caught on the left side of the railway, in passing
from Rhuabon towards Oswestry.&nbsp; The Nant-y-Bela Tower, in
&ldquo;The Dingle of the Marten,&rdquo; is another Cenotaph,
erected by the late Sir W. W. Wynn, after a design by Sir Jeffrey
Wyattville, in memory of his brother officers and private
soldiers slain in Ireland during the rebellion of 1798.&nbsp; It
stands on an eminence, and commands a view of the Vale of
Llangollen, for several miles.&nbsp; The Waterloo Tower, close
also to the railway, is another ornament to the park.</p>
<p>In the days of Sir W. W. Wynn, grandfather to the present
baronet, theatrical performances were often given during the
Christmas Holy days, in a neat theatre near the house, erected
for the purpose.&nbsp; David Garrick, &ldquo;the British,
Roscius,&rdquo; as he was called, frequently superintended these
histrionic displays, where wit and revelry prevailed.&nbsp; The
surrounding nobility and gentry participated in these
festivities, which uniformly passed off with
<i>ecl&acirc;t</i>.&nbsp; The late Sir W. W. Wynn divested this
Thespian Temple of its ornaments, and <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>appropriated it for an annual
agricultural meeting, as an auxiliary to the society at
Wrexham.&nbsp; An annual show of cattle was held at Wynnstay,
where premiums were adjudged, for the best of every species of
stock, for ploughing the greatest number of acres, with two
horses a-breast, without a driver, &amp;c.&nbsp; This bucolic
fete was generally held in September, when a numerous assemblage
of practical agriculturists attended.&nbsp; A dinner at the hall
followed, where covers were laid for five or six hundred
persons.&nbsp; The tables groaned beneath the weight of viands,
including fine samples of roast beef and unctuous venison;
&ldquo;rosy wine&rdquo; spread its charms along the festive
board, and &ldquo;old October,&rdquo; from the cellars of
Wynnstay, were handed round in huge flagons worthy of the
merriest days of Cambria.&nbsp; On these occasions Sir Watkin
generally presided, and did the honours of the table with an
urbanity and cheerful hospitality that endeared him to all his
visitors.</p>
<p>The present Sir W. W. Wynn represents in parliament the county
of Denbigh, is Steward of the Lordships of Bromfield and Yale,
and is Lieutenant-Colonel of the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry
Cavalry.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the more attractive residences in the immediate suburbs
of the town the following claim a brief notice:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Broom Hall</span>, the residence of Mrs.
Aubrey, widow of the late H. P. T. Aubrey, Esq., is situated near
to the town, on the west side.&nbsp; Mr. Aubrey died in
1848.&nbsp; [See p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page143">143</a></span>.]&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Drenewydd</span> stands about a mile and a-half
from Oswestry, on the road leading to Whittington, is a very
ancient house, and has some interesting historical facts
connected with it.&nbsp; It was formerly the residence of Edward
Lloyd, Esq., eldest son of Marmaduke Lloyd, Esq., by Penelope,
daughter of Charles Goodman, Esq.&nbsp; He was eminent for his
learning, and after a long and diligent search into ancient
records, wrote <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>a history of his native county, but did not live to
publish it.&nbsp; A MS. copy of his learned works is preserved in
the Bodleian Library, Oxford.&nbsp; He was elected Mayor of
Oswestry in 1707; in which office, it is recorded of him,
&ldquo;he corrected many existing abuses.&rdquo;&nbsp; He left an
only son, Charles, who was the last in the male line of the
Drenewydd family.&nbsp; The old house at Drenewydd is now the
property of William Ormsby Gore, Esq., and is occupied as a farm
house.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mount Pleasant</span>, the seat
of Thomas L. Longueville, Esq., (a gentleman distinguished for
his public and private worth,) is situated about one mile from
Oswestry, on the road leading to Llansilin.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Oakhurst</span>, a newly-erected mansion, about one
mile north-west of Oswestry, on the road leading to Selattyn,
commands extensive and delightful views of the surrounding
country, including the Vale of Salop and the Breidden
hills.&nbsp; It is built in the Elizabethan style of
architecture, and is the property and residence of R. J.
Venables, Esq., one of the Magistrates of the county, and a
Director of the Great Western and Oswestry and Newtown Railway
Companies.&nbsp; The family of Mr. Venables have for many years
been honourably connected with the borough of Oswestry.&nbsp; At
<span class="smcap">Rhyd-y-Croesau</span> is the residence of the
Rev. Robert Williams, author of &ldquo;Biographical Dictionary of
Eminent Welshmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Williams is a profound
scholar, and his location in the district, at the head of an
ably-conducted school, may be looked upon as a great advantage to
the inhabitants generally.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Pentrepant</span>, the property of T. G. Warrington
Carew, Esq., is the residence of Colonel Frederick Hill.&nbsp; It
is about one mile from Oswestry, on the road to Selattyn.&nbsp;
The estate was for many generations in the Hanmer family, and
John Hanmer, Bishop of St. Asaph, resided here.&nbsp; He died in
1629, and was buried in the church of Selattyn, to the poor of
which parish, and also of Oswestry and St. Asaph, he gave
&pound;15 to be equally divided between them.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Penylan</span> is a very beautiful House, about one
mile from Oswestry.&nbsp; The pleasure-grounds and shrubberies
are laid out with much taste and skill.&nbsp; It is the <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>residence
of Mrs. Longueville, (Widow of the late T. L. Longueville, Esq.,)
a lady of enlarged benevolence, and who has ever shewn herself
ready to alleviate the sufferings of the poorer classes of the
district.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Sweeney Hall</span>, situated
about two miles from Oswestry, on the left of the road to
Welshpool, is a handsome mansion built of freestone, and
beautifully placed in the midst of a well-timbered park.&nbsp;
The house was erected by the late Thomas Netherton Parker, Esq.,
a gentleman who will be long remembered as an active and
impartial Magistrate of the county; as an enlightened landed
proprietor; and a liberal and warm-hearted friend to the poor of
his district.&nbsp; Mr. Parker was an able writer on agricultural
and social economy, and some clever essays from his pen show how
intimately acquainted he was with the condition of the rural
population of all classes.&nbsp; He was an ardent promoter of
agriculture, and most assiduously employed himself for its
practical advancement.&nbsp; The estate is now the property of
his son, the Rev. John Parker, Vicar of Llanyblodwel, and the
house is occupied by Hugh Beavor, Esq.&nbsp; Some particulars
relative to the ancient burial-ground upon the estate are given
in page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page153">153</a></span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Wood
Hill Hall</span>, about two miles from Oswestry, on the right of
the road to Llanymynech, was formerly the property of L. J.
Venables, Esq., but has recently been purchased, and is now
occupied by J. Lees, Esq.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In closing our <span class="smcap">Sketches</span> of the
<span class="smcap">Environs</span>, a brief reference to Chirk
and Llangollen Vale, both being within half an hour&rsquo;s
railway ride from Oswestry, seems to be necessary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chirk</span> is situated upon the northern
bank of the river Ceiriog, and is a pleasant and somewhat
picturesque village.&nbsp; The entire parish is the property of
Col. Myddelton Biddulph.&nbsp; The church, dedicated to St. Mary,
contains an interesting monument of the gallant Sir Thomas
Myddelton; and in the church-yard are some fine yew trees, the
growth of centuries.&nbsp; <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>There is an excellent inn in the
village, <i>The Chirk Castle Arms</i>, kept by Mr. Moses, who is
also post-master there.&nbsp; From the poor-rate return for the
present year (1855), it appears that the acreage of the parish is
4,635a. 3r. 29p.; the gross rental, &pound;9,401 8s. 4d.; and the
rateable value assessed to the relief of the poor, &pound;9,308
2s. 1d.&nbsp; The present much-respected Vicar is the Rev. Joseph
Maude, who is also, as already stated, Chairman of the Board of
the Oswestry Incorporation.&nbsp; The Vale of the Ceiriog, like
that of the Dee, generally attracts the attention of railway
travellers, from its singular beauty and historical
associations.&nbsp; It is crossed by a Viaduct of the Great
Western Railway, and by an Aqueduct also, extending along the
Ellesmere canal upon long ranges of arches at a considerable
elevation.&nbsp; <i>Llangollen Vale</i> is only a few
minutes&rsquo; ride from Chirk, and, we need not add, &ldquo;the
admired of all observers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tourist is amazed with
the first view obtained of it; its hills and slopes display
enchanting spots, and the beauty of the natural scenery is
increased by the massive elegance of Robertson&rsquo;s railway
viaduct across the Dee, and the classic grace of Telford&rsquo;s
aqueduct.&nbsp; The Vale, on both sides the river Dee, is at
length brought to a high state of cultivation.&nbsp; Looking down
the valley from the railway viaduct, or from the more elevated
portions of the Holyhead road, the scene presents a strange
admixture of beauty and ugliness; and a stranger, for the first
time viewing the scene, would declare, &ldquo;I see nothing but
smoke.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the north side of the river are the
extensive iron works of the New British Iron Company, disgorging
smoke and flame day and night, and on the opposite side of the
river are the Vron limestone quarries and kilns, equally active
in discharging huge volumes of vapour.&nbsp; The tourist must
pass on from these manufacturing localities, and his eye will
soon rest upon scenery of surpassing loveliness and
grandeur.&nbsp; The wood-crowned heights of Trevor, the Eglwyseg
and Berwyn range of mountains, the old battered fortress,
<i>Castell Dinas Bran</i>, the luxuriant Vale, which presents <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>the form of
a capacious amphitheatre, and the Dee, vending its course over
beds of clay-slate, limestone, and granitic
boulders,&mdash;these, with abundance of full-grown timber, snug
villas, white-washed cottages, and well-managed farms, with
fertile fields and well-farmed hill-sides, show of what materials
the panoramic valley is composed.&nbsp; Could Moore have viewed
it, as we have done on a bright summer day, he would have been
constrained to quote his own beautiful line,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The valley lies smiling before
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of <i>Llangollen</i> itself we shall attempt no
description.&nbsp; Its charms have been transmitted to glowing
canvass and sung in rapturous verse from Anna Seward downwards;
its hostelries, the <i>Hand</i> and the <i>Royal Hotels</i>, its
&ldquo;trouts,&rdquo; its mountain mutton, sparkling ale, and
other delicacies, have too long been the &ldquo;household
words&rdquo; of tourists, album-writers, and after-dinner
orators, to render eulogium or even &ldquo;faint praise&rdquo;
from us in the slightest degree necessary.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After these poetic visions it is difficult to descend to sober
reality.&nbsp; The tourist, generally speaking, unless he be a
botanist, a geologist, or an artist, penetrates little beyond the
public highway, except in those localities distinguished by a
waterfall, an ancient castle, or a noble residence.&nbsp;
Thousands of people, from the manufacturing districts, cannot in
their visits to the Principality do more than give a passing
glance to the country through which they hurriedly travel.&nbsp;
In the immediate vicinity of the turnpike-roads on both sides of
the Dee the land there lets at a high price, and, generally
speaking, is ably farmed; and ascending the hills, to the heights
of ten or twelve hundred feet, most of the little inclosures
occupied by small farmers, or by parties engaged principally in
other occupation than that of agriculture, are also well
cultivated, and fetch a rental of from 30s. to 40s. per
acre.&nbsp; Some twenty years ago the mountain-land in the Vale
of Llangollen was deemed common, and but few habitations were
erected <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>upon it; but at the present time neat cottage-dwellings
for the industrious poor are raised in clusters, and most of the
land attached to them is farmed with a skill and success that
would put to the blush many a professed agriculturist.&nbsp; No
doubt that this comparatively high price for mountain-land is
caused by the large number of working-men employed in the various
manufacturing and other working establishments in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Such men require small portions of what is
called occupation land, on which to feed a cow and grow a little
wheat, barley, oats, and potatoes.&nbsp; To them the land even at
the price is an advantage; but still it is a fact worthy of note,
that mountain-land in this busy district is in great demand, and
whenever let fetches a high rental.&nbsp; Such is the influence
of manufactures upon agriculture, both of which, as Sir Josiah
Child said years ago, &ldquo;must wax or wane
together.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
